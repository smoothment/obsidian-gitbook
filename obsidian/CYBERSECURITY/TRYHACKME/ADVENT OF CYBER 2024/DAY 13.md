_This SOC-mas was packed with exploits and hacking,_

_Today's threat - an app, which allows Wares' car tracking._

_Mayor Malware, no doubt, well that's their suspicion!_

_For Glitch and McSkidy, the proof was their mission._

  

Wares are all about security. The Glitch discovers that an app is illegally tracking the cars in Wareville. Not many car thefts in the city warrant such an extreme measure. He reaches out to McSkidy to investigate and identify how the application is tracking them and leaking users' positions.

## Learning Objectives
---
```ad-info
- Learn about WebSockets and their vulnerabilities.
- Learn how WebSocket Message Manipulation can be done.
```


## Introduction to WebSocket
---
WebSockets let your browser and the server keep a constant line of communication open. Unlike the old-school method of asking for something, getting a response, and then hanging up, WebSockets are like keeping the phone line open so you can chat whenever you need to. Once that connection is set up, the client and server can talk back and forth without all the extra requests.

WebSockets are great for live chat apps, real-time games, or any live data feed where you want constant updates. After a quick handshake to get things started, both sides can send messages whenever. This means less overhead and faster communication when you need data flowing in real-time.

## Traditional HTTP Requests vs. WebSocket
---
When you use regular HTTP, your browser sends a request to the server, and the server responds, then closes the connection. If you need new data, you have to make another request. Think of it like knocking on someone's door every time you want something—they'll answer, but it can get tiring if you need updates constantly.

Take a chat app as an example. With HTTP, your browser would keep asking, "Any new messages?" every few seconds. This method, known as polling, works but isn’t efficient. Both the browser and the server end up doing a lot of unnecessary work just to stay updated.

WebSockets handle things differently. Once the connection is established, it remains open, allowing the server to push updates to you whenever there’s something new. It’s more like leaving the door open so updates can come in immediately without the constant back-and-forth. This approach is faster and uses fewer resources.

## WebSocket Vulnerabilities
---
While WebSockets can boost performance, they also come with security risks that developers need to monitor. Since WebSocket connections stay open and active, they can be taken advantage of if the proper security measures aren't in place. Here are some common vulnerabilities:

```ad-summary
- **Weak Authentication and Authorization:** Unlike regular HTTP, WebSockets don't have built-in ways to handle user authentication or session validation. If you don't set these controls up properly, attackers could slip in and get access to sensitive data or mess with the connection.
- **Message Tampering:** WebSockets let data flow back and forth constantly, which means attackers could intercept and change messages if encryption isn't used. This could allow them to inject harmful commands, perform actions they shouldn't, or mess with the sent data.
- **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH):** This happens when an attacker tricks a user's browser into opening a WebSocket connection to another site. If successful, the attacker might be able to hijack that connection or access data meant for the legitimate server.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Because WebSocket connections stay open, they can be targeted by DoS attacks. An attacker could flood the server with a ton of messages, potentially slowing it down or crashing it altogether.
```

## What Is WebSocket Message Manipulation?
----

WebSocket Message Manipulation is when an attacker intercepts and changes the messages sent between a web app and its server. Unlike regular HTTP requests that go back and forth one at a time, WebSockets keep a connection open, allowing constant two-way communication. This is what makes WebSockets great for real-time apps, but it also opens the door for attacks if proper security isn't in place.

In this type of attack, a hacker could intercept and tweak these WebSocket messages as they're being sent. Let's say the app is sending sensitive info, like transaction details or user commands—an attacker could change those messages to make the app behave differently. They could bypass security checks, send unauthorised requests, or alter key data like usernames, payment amounts, or access levels.

For example, imagine a web app using WebSockets to handle money transfers between accounts. If an attacker gets hold of the message before it hits the server, they could change the amount being transferred or even send the money to a different account. Since WebSocket connections happen in real-time, these changes would take effect instantly without the user or server noticing immediately.

This kind of manipulation can also lead to more significant problems. Hackers could inject harmful code or try to get higher-level access. For instance, they might change a message to give themselves admin rights or insert malicious commands to take control of the server.

What makes this attack so dangerous is that WebSocket connections often don't have the same security protections as traditional HTTP connections, like End-to-End Encryption, which encrypts the request body of an HTTP request using JavaScript using an AES key or RSA public key stored in the JavaScript file. If developers don't add vigorous checks like message validation or encryption, it's easy for attackers to exploit these gaps. By tampering with the data being sent, attackers can cause all sorts of damage, from unauthorised actions to full system compromises.

The impact of changing WebSocket messages depends on how the app uses them and what kind of data is being sent. Here's a breakdown of what can happen:

```ad-summary
- **Doing Things Without Permission:** If someone can tamper with WebSocket messages, they could impersonate another user and carry out unauthorised actions such as making purchases, transferring funds, or changing account settings. For example, if a WebSocket manages payment transactions, an attacker could manipulate the transaction amount or reroute the payment to their own account.
- **Gaining Extra Privileges:** Attackers could also manipulate messages to make the system think they have more privileges than they actually do. This could let them access admin controls, change user data, view sensitive info, or mess with system settings.
- **Messing Up Data:** One of the significant risks is data corruption. If someone is changing the messages, they could feed bad data into the system. This could mess with user accounts, transactions, or anything else the app handles. They could change things in real-time and disrupt everyone's work in circumstances such as a shared document or tool.
- **Crashing the System:** An attacker could also spam the server with bad requests, causing it to slow down or crash. If this happens enough, the system could go offline, causing serious downtime for users and businesses.
```

Without good security checks, this kind of message tampering can lead to anything from unauthorized actions to the downing of an entire service.

## Exploitation
---

Navigate to [http://10.10.159.118](http://10.10.159.118/).

![[Pasted image 20241213125042.png]]

Intercept the request with burp and go back to the browser to click the track button:

![[Pasted image 20241213125123.png]]

Burp Proxy will intercept the WebSocket traffic, as shown below.

![Traffic from the web is captured showing user with ID number 5 being tracked.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2/room-content/645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2-1731078744669.png)

Change the value of the userId parameter from 5 to 8 and click the Forward button.

**Note**: If you don't see the traffic. Try to click the untrack button, refresh the page, and hit the track button again.

## Manipulating the Messaging

Following the successful identification of the WebSocket Message Manipulation vulnerability, Glitch continued testing for other ways to exploit the application. This time, he wanted to see if the messages posted on the app could be altered and manipulated. Is it possible to post using a different user ID?

## Questions
---

![[Pasted image 20241213130205.png]]

### FLAG 1
---

To get the value of flag1, we must change the `userid` to `8`:

![[Pasted image 20241213130236.png]]

Once we've changed that, click forward and turn the intercept off, once done, we get this output:

![[Pasted image 20241213130457.png]]

So, flag1 is: `THM{dude_where_is_my_car}`


### FLAG 2
----

To get flag2, we need to manipulate a message as mayor malware, since we know his `userid` is `8`, we can send the same request, but change the message in the following way:

First, let's send a message by ourselves, and change the ID to any other ID to check if it works:

![[Pasted image 20241213131110.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241213131117.png]]

So, let's send it to repeater, turning off the interception and modify the `sender` parameter to `8` to check if it works:



![[Pasted image 20241213131325.png]]

It worked! Flag 2 is: `THM{my_name_is_malware._mayor_malware}`


Just like that, day 13 is done!
