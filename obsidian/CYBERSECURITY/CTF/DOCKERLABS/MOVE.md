# ENUMERATION


## OPEN PORTS

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025014342.png)


```ad-note
OPEN PORTS

21: `FTP (Anonymous login enabled)`
22: `SSH`
80: `HTTP`
3000: `HTTP`

```

First, we need to log into ftp taking advantage of that anonymous login that's enabled:

We have a directory called `mantenimiento`, inside of this directory, we can find the following:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025014619.png)

A `database.kdbx` file is found inside of it, let's download it to our host machine and inspect it:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025014823.png)

If we try to use `keepass2` on the file, it is protected by a password, let's start with our websites enumeration to get that password.

We have two websites, let's try to enumerate them further using fuzzing and other techniques

## FUZZING

### PORT 80 WEBSITE

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025014929.png)

Found a `/maintenance.html` directory that may be useful, let's visit it:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025015023.png)

So, seems like the password is in the `/tmp` directory, seems like we need to perform a path traversal in some sort of way to get that, let's enumerate the other website



### PORT 3000 WEBSITE

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025013600.png)
A lot came from it, so, fuzzing seems pretty useless here, let's visit the website:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025013631.png)

Default page is a login page, something interest I found was this:


![](Pasted%20image%2020241025015156.png)


Seems like it is running a `grafana` om the `v8.3.0`, let's search for some exploit in this version

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025015326.png)

Perfect, found exactly what I needed, a [[CYBERSECURITY/Bug Bounty/Vulnerabilities/SERVER SIDE VULNERABILITIES/PATH TRAVERSAL|path traversal]] vulnerability that allow us to read that `/tmp/pass.txt` file:

# EXPLOITATION

## LAUNCHING THE EXPLOIT

So, with the exploit in our hands, let's start with the next stage, let's launch the attack and try to read `/etc/passwd` to check if it works:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025015835.png)
And it works correctly, let's read our `/tmp/pass.txt` file!

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025015908.png)

```ad-hint
`/tmp/pass.txt`: `t9sH76gpQ82UFeZ3GXZS`
```


Nice, we got what we needed, let's log in ssh using that password and the user `freddy` we previously read in that `/etc/passwd` file:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025020149.png)

Nice, we got access, let's start with the privilege escalation.

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION



## SUDO -L

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025020240.png)

Seems like we have a `/opt/maintenance.py` file we can exploit in order to get root access, let's check at the code:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025020359.png)

Something simple, just a print statement on it, let's check if we can write in it:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025020446.png)

And we can indeed write in it, let's escalate our privileges, for this, I used this code:

```python
import os
os.system("/usr/bin/python3 -c 'import os; os.system(\"/bin/bash\")'")
```

This will pop a new shell with root privileges:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241025020740.png)

And just like that, the CTF is done!
