## OPEN PORTS

| PORT | SERVICE |

| 80   | http    |
| 8080 | http    |

Let's start reconnaissance.

# RECONNAISSANCE
---

We have two websites, let's visit them both

### Port 80
---

![[Pasted image 20250111142532.png]]

Source code is normal too, let's visit the other one.

### Port 8080
---

![[Pasted image 20250111142600.png]]

Weird, if we watch the source code, we can see the following:

![[Pasted image 20250111142812.png]]
So, I think fuzzing in both websites would be useful in this case, let's proceed.


## Fuzzing
----

### 80
---

![[Pasted image 20250111142908.png]]

We got `assets` and `images`, if we visit them, we get status code `403`, which means we don't have enough permissions to read them. Let's fuzz other port

### 8080
----

Once we visit `/website`, this happens:

![[Pasted image 20250111143118.png]]

Tried fuzzing but nothing useful came from it, let's visit `/console`

![[Pasted image 20250111144530.png]]

We get a redirect but nothing else.


That's when I knew I needed a different approach, so, I went back to the site on port 80 and explored further:

![[Pasted image 20250113153001.png]]

If we go to `/contact`, we can see something interesting written on there, it is talking about something called `silverpeas` and it gives us an username: `scr1ptkiddy`, after a research, I found the following: 

![[Pasted image 20250113153158.png]]

Silverpeas usually runs on port 8080, let's check if that's the case for this machine:

![[Pasted image 20250113153247.png]]

That's right, let's begin exploitation.


# EXPLOITATION
---

We already know we have `silverpeas` running on port 8080, let's search any sort of exploit to bypass the login panel:

![[Pasted image 20250113153358.png]]

Found this GitHub page which talks about `Authentication Bypass` in the `silverpeas` CRM, let's check the PoC:

![[Pasted image 20250113153444.png]]

Let's fire up burp and try:

![[Pasted image 20250113153608.png]]

Let's follow the PoC and delete the password field:

![[Pasted image 20250113153636.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250113153653.png]]

We get a GET request, let's forward:

![[Pasted image 20250113153801.png]]

We got in, time to explore:

![[Pasted image 20250113154552.png]]


![[Pasted image 20250113153844.png]]

Found an unread notification, if we read it, we find there's 2 more users: `Manager` and `Administrateur` let's log into both accounts following the same PoC from earlier:

![[Pasted image 20250113154718.png]]

In `Manager`, we find ssh credentials:

```ad-note

#### Credentials
----

`tim`:`cm0nt!md0ntf0rg3tth!spa$$w0rdagainlol`

```

We are unable to log into `Administrateur` account using the same method, but we don't need to, let's log into ssh:

![[Pasted image 20250113154929.png]]

```ad-important
 User: `THM{c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b}`
```

Time to start with privilege escalation.

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
---

We already have initial access on Tim's account, let's use linpeas to enumerate possible PE vectors:


![[Pasted image 20250113162507.png]]


`Tim`is part of the `adm` group, let's check that:

![[Pasted image 20250113162540.png]]

It is indeed right, let's check `/etc/passwd`:

![[Pasted image 20250113162609.png]]

We have another user, `tyler`, we can perform the following:

```ad-hint
1. grep -Ri 'password' /var/log 2>/dev/null
2. Check for any password regarding `tyler` user
3. Switch user to `tyler`

#### Output
---

![[Pasted image 20250113162806.png]]

We are able to see we got a password: `_Zd_zx7N823/`, let's switch:

![[Pasted image 20250113162843.png]]

```

Nice, we got a shell as `tyler`, let's check the sudo permissions:

![[Pasted image 20250113162921.png]]

Lucky, we can just perform `sudo bash -p` and get a root as shell:

![[Pasted image 20250113162947.png]]

Just like that, CTF is done:

![[Pasted image 20250113163008.png]]

```ad-important
Root: `THM{098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6}`
```
