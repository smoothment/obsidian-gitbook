# What is a large language model?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI algorithms that can process user inputs and create plausible responses by predicting sequences of words. They are trained on huge semi-public data sets, using machine learning to analyze how the component parts of language fit together.

LLMs usually present a chat interface to accept user input, known as a prompt. The input allowed is controlled in part by input validation rules.

LLMs can have a wide range of use cases in modern websites:

- **Customer service, such as a virtual assistant.
- **Translation.
- **SEO improvement**.
- **Analysis of user-generated content, for example to track the tone of on-page comments**.
