Active plugins should not be our only area of focus when assessing a WordPress website. Even if a plugin is deactivated, it may still be accessible, and therefore we can gain access to its associated scripts and functions. Deactivating a vulnerable plugin does not improve the WordPress site's security. It is best practice to either remove or keep up-to-date any unused plugins.

The following example shows a disabled plugin.

If we browse to the plugins directory, we can see that we still have access to the `Mail Masta` plugin.

We can also view the directory listing using cURL and convert the HTML output to a nice readable format using `html2text`.

```shell-session
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ curl -s -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/ | html2text

This type of access is called `Directory Indexing`. It allows us to navigate the folder and access files that may contain sensitive information or vulnerable code. It is best practice to disable directory indexing on web servers so a potential attacker cannot gain direct access to any files or folders other than those necessary for the website to function properly.
