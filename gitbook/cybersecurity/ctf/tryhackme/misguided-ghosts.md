Ftp anonymous login is enabled, let's check it up:

As seen, we are able to get some files, let's take a look at them:

```bash
cat info.txt; cat jokes.txt
I have included all the network info you requested, along with some of my favourite jokes.

- Paramore

Taylor: Knock, knock.
Josh:   Who's there?
Taylor: The interrupting cow.
Josh:   The interrupting cow--
Taylor: Moo

Josh:   Knock, knock.
Taylor: Who's there?
Josh:   Adore.
Taylor: Adore who?
Josh:   Adore is between you and I so please open up!
```

There is a hint on the `jokes.txt`  file as it hints on `port knocking`,  Port knocking is a stealthy method used to open closed ports on a firewall by sending a specific sequence of connection attempts (knocks) to predefined ports. These ports appear closed from the outside, but when the correct sequence is received, the firewall temporarily opens a port (e.g., SSH) for the client. Itâ€™s like a secret handshake, only those who know the right knock pattern can get in. This technique adds an extra layer of obscurity and is often used to hide services from unauthorized users.

Check more info on `port knocking` below:

Based on the info file, we have all the network info needed on the `trace.pcapng` file, let's take a look at it, we can use wireshark for it:

We can see some TCP requests being made to:

```
192.168.236.131
```

Let's try to filter by this ip with:

```
ip.addr == 192.168.236.131
```
