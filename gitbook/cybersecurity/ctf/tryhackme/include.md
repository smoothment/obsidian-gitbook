# RECONNAISSANCE

Let's go into both websites:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502222339.png)

Let's go with the one located at port `4000` first, we can login using:

```
guest:guest
```


![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502222618.png)


If we go to any profile, we can see this:


![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502222747.png)

We can `Recommend Activities`, let's send a test request and check how it behaves:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502222938.png)


We get a redirection, `XSS` and `SQLI` does not work on here, it only reflects in this way:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502223244.png)

But, there's no execution or anything like that, the interesting stuff in here is the `isAdmin` section, if we can modify that to true, we may be able to become admin user on here, we need to send a request with the following stuff:


![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502223530.png)


We can now see this:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502223604.png)

Let's go with the exploitation phase.


# EXPLOITATION
---

We became admin and two functionalities were added to the panel:


![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502223632.png)

We got `API` and `Settings`, let's check them both:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502223732.png)

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502223740.png)

Both are useful, we got some info from the API and an update banner image url functionality, I tried uploading a shell from a python server to get RCE but it didn't worked, that's when i realized i can maybe get the hidden contents from the `http://127.0.0.1:5000/getAllAdmins101099991` API service:


![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502224237.png)

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502224245.png)

We get an encoded base64 response, let's decode it:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502224337.png)

As seen, we get this:

```json
{"ReviewAppUsername":"admin","ReviewAppPassword":"admin@!!!","SysMonAppUsername":"administrator","SysMonAppPassword":"c"}
```

These seem to be the credentials for the web application located at port `50000`, let's try them:

```
administrator:S$9$qk6d#**LQU
```


![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502224615.png)


We got first flag:

```
THM{!50_55Rf_1S_d_k3Y??!}
```

If we fuzz this page, we can find this:

```

```


We got `profile.php`:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502225430.png)

Seems like we need a parameter, if we check source code of the dashboard, we can see the following:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502225353.png)


We can now see the way it must be formatted, let's submit the request to our proxy to check it better:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250502225636.png)

The structure of the URL may be vulnerable to LFI, let's send this to `Automate` and send some `LFI payloads`, I used the following wordlist:

We got an user named `joshua`, let's bruteforce our way in:

hydra -l joshua -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt include.thm ssh
[22][ssh] host: include.thm   login: joshua   password: 123456
```

We can now go in ssh:
