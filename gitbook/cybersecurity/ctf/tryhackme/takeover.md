# RECONNAISSANCE

We need to perform subdomain scan in the `futurevera.thm` target, let's begin by adding it to `/etc/hosts`:

```
echo 'IP futurevera.thm' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Let's perform a scan with ffuf


```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u http://futurevera.thm -H "Host: FUZZ.futurevera.thm" -mc 200,301,302 -fs 0 -t 100 -ic -c

We found another subdomains, let's check it out:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250331144920.png)

Since the page is only available through the internal VPN, we can check if it's vulnerable to `subdomain takeover`:

```
dig portal.futurevera.thm CNAME +short
dig payroll.futurevera.thm CNAME +short
```

No output occurs, so, this is not the intended path to take, maybe we missed something, for example, let's check the main page:

Nothing interesting on here too, but, remember we got a `https` site, let's fuzz by `https` instead of `http`:

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u https://10.10.236.142 -H "Host: FUZZ.futurevera.thm" -mc 200,301,302 -fs 4605 -t 100 -ic -c

We can go into `support.futurevera.thm`:

# EXPLOITATION

The moment we enter the `support.futurevera.thm`, it says it uses a `self-signed` certificate, let's check it out:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250331145727.png)

We find this, another subdomain hidden, let's add it too and check it out, we need to access this through port `80`:

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250331150148.png)

We got our flag:


```
flag{beea0d6edfcee06a59b83fb50ae81b2f}
