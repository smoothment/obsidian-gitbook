To start API testing, you first need to find out as much information about the API as possible, to discover its attack surface.

To begin, you should identify API endpoints. These are locations where an API receives requests about a specific resource on its server. For example, consider the following GET request:

```
GET /api/books HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

The API endpoint for this request is `/api/books`. This results in an interaction with the API to retrieve a list of books from a library. Another API endpoint might be, for example,`/api/books/mystery`, which would retrieve a list of mystery books.

Once you have identified the endpoints, you need to determine how to interact with them. This enables you to construct valid HTTP requests to test the API. For example, you should find out information about the following:

```ad-summary
- The input data the API processes, including both compulsory and optional parameters.
- The types of requests the API accepts, including supported HTTP methods and media formats.
- Rate limits and authentication mechanisms.
```

# API documentation

APIs are usually documented so that developers know how to use and integrate with them.

Documentation can be in both human-readable and machine-readable forms. Human-readable documentation is designed for developers to understand how to use the API. It may include detailed explanations, examples, and usage scenarios. Machine-readable documentation is designed to be processed by software for automating tasks like API integration and validation. It's written in structured formats like JSON or XML.

API documentation is often publicly available, particularly if the API is intended for use by external developers. If this is the case, always start your recon by reviewing the documentation.
## Discovering API documentation

Even if API documentation isn't openly available, you may still be able to access it by browsing applications that use the API.

To do this, you can use Burp Scanner to crawl the API. You can also browse applications manually using Burp's browser. Look for endpoints that may refer to API documentation, for example:

```ad-info
    /api
    /swagger/index.html
    /openapi.json
```

If you identify an endpoint for a resource, make sure to investigate the base path. For example, if you identify the resource endpoint `/api/swagger/v1/users/123`, then you should investigate the following paths:

```ad-info
    /api/swagger/v1
    /api/swagger
    /api
```
You can also use a list of common paths to find documentation using Intruder.
