Many websites allow users to store results on a PDF file, but, some of them are programmed poorly, so, vulnerabilities can be exploited, let's see:


# WHERE DO THE RISK BEGIN

Risk begins if:

1. User input is not sanitized properly.
2. Backend not programmed properly.
3. Poor validation.


If the website does not follow a good security path, it may be vulnerable to:

- [[CYBERSECURITY/Bug Bounty/Vulnerabilities/SERVER SIDE VULNERABILITIES/INJECTIONS/HTML INJECTION|HTML INJECTION]]
- [[CYBERSECURITY/Bug Bounty/Vulnerabilities/SERVER SIDE VULNERABILITIES/CROSS SITE SCRIPTING/CROSS SITE SCRIPTING (XSS)|Cross Site Scripting (XSS)]]
- [[CYBERSECURITY/Bug Bounty/Vulnerabilities/SERVER SIDE VULNERABILITIES/FILE INCLUSION VULNERABILITIES/LOCAL FILE INCLUSION (LFI)|Local File Inclusion (LFI)]]
