# CRYPTOGRAPHIC FAILURES

### Description

The first thing is to determine the protection needs of data in transit and at rest. For example, passwords, credit card numbers, health records, personal information, and business secrets require extra protection, mainly if that data falls under privacy laws, e.g., EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or regulations, e.g., financial data protection such as PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). For all such data:

* Is any data transmitted in clear text? This concerns protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP also using TLS upgrades like STARTTLS. External internet traffic is hazardous. Verify all internal traffic, e.g., between load balancers, web servers, or back-end systems.
* Are any old or weak cryptographic algorithms or protocols used either by default or in older code?
* Are default crypto keys in use, weak crypto keys generated or re-used, or is proper key management or rotation missing? Are crypto keys checked into source code repositories?
* Is encryption not enforced, e.g., are any HTTP headers (browser) security directives or headers missing?
* Is the received server certificate and the trust chain properly validated?
* Are initialization vectors ignored, reused, or not generated sufficiently secure for the cryptographic mode of operation? Is an insecure mode of operation such as ECB in use? Is encryption used when authenticated encryption is more appropriate?
* Are passwords being used as cryptographic keys in absence of a password base key derivation function?
* Is randomness used for cryptographic purposes that was not designed to meet cryptographic requirements? Even if the correct function is chosen, does it need to be seeded by the developer, and if not, has the developer over-written the strong seeding functionality built into it with a seed that lacks sufficient entropy/unpredictability?
* Are deprecated hash functions such as MD5 or SHA1 in use, or are non-cryptographic hash functions used when cryptographic hash functions are needed?
* Are deprecated cryptographic padding methods such as PKCS number 1 v1.5 in use?
* Are cryptographic error messages or side channel information exploitable, for example in the form of padding oracle attacks?

See ASVS Crypto (V7), Data Protection (V9), and SSL/TLS (V10)

### How to Prevent

Do the following, at a minimum, and consult the references:

* Classify data processed, stored, or transmitted by an application. Identify which data is sensitive according to privacy laws, regulatory requirements, or business needs.
* Don't store sensitive data unnecessarily. Discard it as soon as possible or use PCI DSS compliant tokenization or even truncation. Data that is not retained cannot be stolen.
* Make sure to encrypt all sensitive data at rest.
* Ensure up-to-date and strong standard algorithms, protocols, and keys are in place; use proper key management.
* Encrypt all data in transit with secure protocols such as TLS with forward secrecy (FS) ciphers, cipher prioritization by the server, and secure parameters. Enforce encryption using directives like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
* Disable caching for response that contain sensitive data.
* Apply required security controls as per the data classification.
* Do not use legacy protocols such as FTP and SMTP for transporting sensitive data.
* Store passwords using strong adaptive and salted hashing functions with a work factor (delay factor), such as Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt or PBKDF2.
* Initialization vectors must be chosen appropriate for the mode of operation. For many modes, this means using a CSPRNG (cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator). For modes that require a nonce, then the initialization vector (IV) does not need a CSPRNG. In all cases, the IV should never be used twice for a fixed key.
* Always use authenticated encryption instead of just encryption.
* Keys should be generated cryptographically randomly and stored in memory as byte arrays. If a password is used, then it must be converted to a key via an appropriate password base key derivation function.
* Ensure that cryptographic randomness is used where appropriate, and that it has not been seeded in a predictable way or with low entropy. Most modern APIs do not require the developer to seed the CSPRNG to get security.
* Avoid deprecated cryptographic functions and padding schemes, such as MD5, SHA1, PKCS number 1 v1.5 .
* Verify independently the effectiveness of configuration and settings.

### Example Attack Scenarios

**Scenario #1**: An application encrypts credit card numbers in a database using automatic database encryption. However, this data is automatically decrypted when retrieved, allowing a SQL injection flaw to retrieve credit card numbers in clear text.

**Scenario #2**: A site doesn't use or enforce TLS for all pages or supports weak encryption. An attacker monitors network traffic (e.g., at an insecure wireless network), downgrades connections from HTTPS to HTTP, intercepts requests, and steals the user's session cookie. The attacker then replays this cookie and hijacks the user's (authenticated) session, accessing or modifying the user's private data. Instead of the above they could alter all transported data, e.g., the recipient of a money transfer.

**Scenario #3**: The password database uses unsalted or simple hashes to store everyone's passwords. A file upload flaw allows an attacker to retrieve the password database. All the unsalted hashes can be exposed with a rainbow table of pre-calculated hashes. Hashes generated by simple or fast hash functions may be cracked by GPUs, even if they were salted.

## POC

## SUPPORTING MATERIAL

The most common way to store a large amount of data in a format easily accessible from many locations is in a database. This is perfect for something like a web application, as many users may interact with the website at any time. Database engines usually follow the Structured Query Language (SQL) syntax.

In a production environment, it is common to see databases set up on dedicated servers running a database service such as MySQL or MariaDB; however, databases can also be stored as files. These are referred to as "flat-file" databases, as they are stored as a single file on the computer. This is much easier than setting up an entire database server and could potentially be seen in smaller web applications. Accessing a database server is outwith the scope of today's task, so let's focus instead on flat-file databases.

As mentioned previously, flat-file databases are stored as a file on the disk of a computer. Usually, this would not be a problem for a web app, but what happens if the database is stored underneath the root directory of the website (i.e. one of the files accessible to the user connecting to the website)? Well, we can download and query it on our own machine, with full access to everything in the database. Sensitive Data Exposure, indeed!

That is a big hint for the challenge, so let's briefly cover some of the syntax we would use to query a flat-file database.

The most common (and simplest) format of a flat-file database is an SQLite database. These can be interacted with in most programming languages and have a dedicated client for querying them on the command line. This client is called `sqlite3` and is installed on many Linux distributions by default.

Let's suppose we have successfully managed to download a database:

Linux

```shell-session
user@linux$ ls -l 
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 8192 Feb  2 20:33 example.db
                                                                                                                                                              
user@linux$ file example.db 
example.db: SQLite 3.x database, last written using SQLite version 3039002, file counter 1, database pages 2, cookie 0x1, schema 4, UTF-8, version-valid-for 1
```

We can see that there is an SQLite database in the current folder.

To access it, we use `sqlite3 <database-name>`:

Linux

```shell-session
user@linux$ sqlite3 example.db                     
SQLite version 3.39.2 2022-07-21 15:24:47
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> 
```

From here, we can see the tables in the database by using the `.tables` command:

Linux

```shell-session
user@linux$ sqlite3 example.db                     
SQLite version 3.39.2 2022-07-21 15:24:47
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .tables
customers
```

At this point, we can dump all the data from the table, but we won't necessarily know what each column means unless we look at the table information. First, let's use `PRAGMA table_info(customers);` to see the table information. Then we'll use `SELECT * FROM customers;` to dump the information from the table:

Linux

```shell-session
sqlite> PRAGMA table_info(customers);
0|cudtID|INT|1||1
1|custName|TEXT|1||0
2|creditCard|TEXT|0||0
3|password|TEXT|1||0

sqlite> SELECT * FROM customers;
0|Joy Paulson|4916 9012 2231 7905|5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
1|John Walters|4671 5376 3366 8125|fef08f333cc53594c8097eba1f35726a
2|Lena Abdul|4353 4722 6349 6685|b55ab2470f160c331a99b8d8a1946b19
3|Andrew Miller|4059 8824 0198 5596|bc7b657bd56e4386e3397ca86e378f70
4|Keith Wayman|4972 1604 3381 8885|12e7a36c0710571b3d827992f4cfe679
5|Annett Scholz|5400 1617 6508 1166|e2795fc96af3f4d6288906a90a52a47f
```

We can see from the table information that there are four columns: `custID`, `custName`, `creditCard` and `password`. You may notice that this matches up with the results. Take the first row:

`0|Joy Paulson|4916 9012 2231 7905|5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99`&#x20;

We have the custID (0), the custName (Joy Paulson), the creditCard (4916 9012 2231 7905) and a password hash (5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99).

In the next task, we'll look at cracking this hash.

### SECOND PART

We saw how to query an SQLite database for sensitive data in the previous task. We found a collection of password hashes, one for each user. In this task, we will briefly cover how to crack these.

When it comes to hash cracking, Kali comes pre-installed with various tools. If you know how to use these, then feel free to do so; however, they are outwith the scope of this material.

Instead, we will be using the online tool: [Crackstation](https://crackstation.net/). This website is extremely good at cracking weak password hashes. For more complicated hashes, we would need more sophisticated tools; however, all of the crackable password hashes used in today's challenge are weak MD5 hashes, which Crackstation should handle very nicely.

When we navigate to the website, we are met with the following interface:

![Crackstation](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/89ce8684674027b9a6fb6d5755d53074.png)

Let's try pasting the password hash for Joy Paulson, which we found in the previous task (`5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99`). We solve the Captcha, then click the "Crack Hashes" button:

![Cracked Password](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/6c4321e296cbf60e4f53417dd7a9146c.png)

We see that the hash was successfully broken, and the user's password was "password". How secure!

It's worth noting that Crackstation works using a massive wordlist. If the password is not in the wordlist, then Crackstation will not be able to break the hash.

The challenge is guided, so if Crackstation fails to break a hash in today's box, you can assume that the hash has been specifically designed not to be crackable.
