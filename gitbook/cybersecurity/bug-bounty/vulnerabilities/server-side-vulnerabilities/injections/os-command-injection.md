# What is OS command injection?

OS command injection is also known as shell injection. It allows an attacker to execute operating system (OS) commands on the server that is running an application, and typically fully compromise the application and its data. Often, an attacker can leverage an OS command injection vulnerability to compromise other parts of the hosting infrastructure, and exploit trust relationships to pivot the attack to other systems within the organization.

Command Injection occurs when server-side code (like PHP) in a web application makes a call to a function that interacts with the server's console directly. An injection web vulnerability allows an attacker to take advantage of that call to execute operating system commands arbitrarily on the server. The possibilities for the attacker from here are endless: they could list files, read their contents, run some basic commands to do some recon on the server or whatever they wanted, just as if they were sitting in front of the server and issuing commands directly into the command line. 

Once the attacker has a foothold on the web server, they can start the usual enumeration of your systems and look for ways to pivot around.

## Code Example

Let's consider a scenario: MooCorp has started developing a web-based application for cow ASCII art with customizable text. While searching for ways to implement their app, they've come across the `cowsay` command in Linux, which does just that! Instead of coding a whole web application and the logic required to make cows talk in ASCII, they decide to write some simple code that calls the cowsay command from the operating system's console and sends back its contents to the website.

Let's look at the code they used for their app.  See if you can determine why their implementation is vulnerable to command injection.  We'll go over it below.

```php
<?php
    if (isset($_GET["mooing"])) {
        $mooing = $_GET["mooing"];
        $cow = 'default';

        if(isset($_GET["cow"]))
            $cow = $_GET["cow"];
        
        passthru("perl /usr/bin/cowsay -f $cow $mooing");
    }
?>
```

In simple terms, the above snippet does the following:  

1. Checking if the parameter "mooing" is set. If it is, the variable `$mooing` gets what was passed into the input field.
2. Checking if the parameter "cow" is set. If it is, the variable `$cow` gets what was passed through the parameter.
3. The program then executes the function `passthru("perl /usr/bin/cowsay -f $cow $mooing");`. The passthru function simply executes a command in the operating system's console and sends the output back to the user's browser. You can see that our command is formed by concatenating the $cow and $mooing variables at the end of it. Since we can manipulate those variables, we can try injecting additional commands by using simple tricks. If you want to, you can read the docs on `passthru()` on [PHP's website](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.passthru.php) for more information on the function itself.

## Exploiting Command Injection

Now that we know how the application works behind the curtains, we will take advantage of a bash feature called "inline commands" to abuse the cowsay server and execute any arbitrary command we want. Bash allows you to run commands within commands. This is useful for many reasons, but in our case, it will be used to inject a command within the cowsay server to get it executed.

To execute inline commands, you only need to enclose them in the following format `$(your_command_here)`. If the console detects an inline command, it will execute it first and then use the result as the parameter for the outer command. Look at the following example, which runs `whoami` as an inline command inside an `echo` command:

![Inline commands](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/b7158502a9799698ec0ab29a850c8840.png)  

So coming back to the cowsay server, here's what would happen if we send an inline command to the web application:

![Sending our payload](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/9f657b909062ac82af12548b4f346aec.png)

Since the application accepts any input from us, we can inject an inline command which will get executed and used as a parameter for cowsay. This will make our cow say whatever the command returns! In case you are not that familiar with Linux, here are some other commands you may want to try:

```ad-important
- `whoami`
- `id`
- `ifconfig/ip addr`
- `uname -a`
- `ps -ef`
```

## Useful commands

After you identify an OS command injection vulnerability, it's useful to execute some initial commands to obtain information about the system. Below is a summary of some commands that are useful on Linux and Windows platforms:

```
Purpose of command 	Linux 	Windows
Name of current user 	whoami 	whoami
Operating system 	uname -a 	ver
Network configuration 	ifconfig 	ipconfig /all
Network connections 	netstat -an 	netstat -an
Running processes 	ps -ef 	tasklist 
```

## Injecting OS commands

In this example, a shopping application lets the user view whether an item is in stock in a particular store. This information is accessed via a URL:

`https://insecure-website.com/stockStatus?productID=381&storeID=29`

To provide the stock information, the application must query various legacy systems. For historical reasons, the functionality is implemented by calling out to a shell command with the product and store IDs as arguments:

`stockreport.pl 381 29`

This command outputs the stock status for the specified item, which is returned to the user.

#### Injecting OS commands - Continued

The application implements no defenses against OS command injection, so an attacker can submit the following input to execute an arbitrary command:

`& echo aiwefwlguh &`

If this input is submitted in the productID parameter, the command executed by the application is:

`stockreport.pl & echo aiwefwlguh & 29`

The echo command causes the supplied string to be echoed in the output. This is a useful way to test for some types of OS command injection. The & character is a shell command separator. In this example, it causes three separate commands to execute, one after another. The output returned to the user is:

```
Error - productID was not provided
aiwefwlguh
29: command not found
```

The three lines of output demonstrate that:

1. The original stockreport.pl command was executed without its expected arguments, and so returned an error message.
2. The injected echo command was executed, and the supplied string was echoed in the output.
3. The original argument 29 was executed as a command, which caused an error.

Placing the additional command separator & after the injected command is useful because it separates the injected command from whatever follows the injection point. This reduces the chance that what follows will prevent the injected command from executing.

# TRYHACKME SECTION


## Discovering Command Injection

---

This vulnerability exists because applications often use functions in programming languages such as PHP, Python and NodeJS to pass data to and to make system calls on the machine’s operating system. For example, taking input from a field and searching for an entry into a file. Take this code snippet below as an example:

In this code snippet, the application takes data that a user enters in an input field named `$title` to search a directory for a song title. Let’s break this down into a few simple steps.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/a54a09f7c4efa1d340ab678ece230c44.png)  

```ad-note
**1.** The application stores MP3 files in a directory contained on the operating system.

**2.** The user inputs the song title they wish to search for. The application stores this input into the `$title` variable.

**3.** The data within this `$title` variable is passed to the command `grep` to search a text file named _songtitle.__txt_ for the entry of whatever the user wishes to search for.

**4.** The output of this search of _songtitle.__txt_ will determine whether the application informs the user that the song exists or not.
```

Now, this sort of information would typically be stored in a database; however, this is just an example of where an application takes input from a user to interact with the application’s operating system.

An attacker could abuse this application by injecting their own commands for the application to execute. Rather than using `grep` to search for an entry in `songtitle.txt`, they could ask the application to read data from a more sensitive file.

Abusing applications in this way can be possible no matter the programming language the application uses. As long as the application processes and executes it, it can result in command injection. For example, this code snippet below is an application written in Python.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/04a1cb87fad0a9b47761afddc48e0bf2.png)  

Note, you are not expected to understand the syntax behind these applications. However, for the sake of reason, I have outlined the steps of how this Python application works as well.

```ad-note

1. The "flask" package is used to set up a web server
2. A function that uses the "subprocess" package to execute a command on the device
3. We use a route in the webserver that will execute whatever is provided. For example, to execute `whoami`, we'd need to visit http://flaskapp.thm/whoami
```


## Exploiting Command Injection
---

You can often determine whether or not command injection may occur by the behaviors of an application, as you will come to see in the practical session of this room.

Applications that use user input to populate system commands with data can often be combined in unintended behavior. **For example, the shell operators `;`, `&` and `&&` will combine two (or more) system commands and execute them both**. If you are unfamiliar with this concept, it is worth checking out the [Linux fundamentals module](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals) to learn more about this.

Command Injection can be detected in mostly one of two ways:

1. Blind command injection
2. Verbose command injection

I have defined these two methods in the table below, where the two sections underneath will explain these in greater detail.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Method**|**Description**|
|Blind|This type of injection is where there is no direct output from the application when testing payloads. You will have to investigate the behaviours of the application to determine whether or not your payload was successful.|
|Verbose|This type of injection is where there is direct feedback from the application once you have tested a payload. For example, running the `whoami` command to see what user the application is running under. The web application will output the username on the page directly.|

  

### Detecting Blind Command Injection
---

Blind command injection is when command injection occurs; however, there is no output visible, so it is not immediately noticeable. For example, a command is executed, but the web application outputs no message.

For this type of command injection, we will need to use payloads that will cause some time delay. For example, the `ping` and `sleep` commands are significant payloads to test with. Using `ping` as an example, the application will hang for _x_ seconds in relation to how many _pings_ you have specified.

Another method of detecting blind command injection is by forcing some output. This can be done by using redirection operators such as `>`. If you are unfamiliar with this, I recommend checking out the [Linux fundamentals module](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals). For example, we can tell the web application to execute commands such as `whoami` and redirect that to a file. We can then use a command such as `cat` to read this newly created file’s contents.

Testing command injection this way is often complicated and requires quite a bit of experimentation, significantly as the syntax for commands varies between Linux and Windows.

The `curl` command is a great way to test for command injection. This is because you are able to use `curl` to deliver data to and from an application in your payload. Take this code snippet below as an example, a simple curl payload to an application is possible for command injection.

`curl http://vulnerable.app/process.php%3Fsearch%3DThe%20Beatles%3B%20whoami`

### Detecting Verbose Command Injection
---
Detecting command injection this way is arguably the easiest method of the two. Verbose command injection is when the application gives you feedback or output as to what is happening or being executed.

For example, the output of commands such as `ping` or `whoami` is directly displayed on the web application.

  

### Useful payloads

I have compiled some valuable payloads for both Linux & Windows into the tables below.

#### Linux

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Payload**|**Description**|
|whoami|See what user the application is running under.|
|ls|List the contents of the current directory. You may be able to find files such as configuration files, environment files (tokens and application keys), and many more valuable things.|
|ping|This command will invoke the application to hang. This will be useful in testing an application for blind command injection.|
|sleep|This is another useful payload in testing an application for blind command injection, where the machine does not have `ping` installed.|
|nc|Netcat can be used to spawn a reverse shell onto the vulnerable application. You can use this foothold to navigate around the target machine for other services, files, or potential means of escalating privileges.|

  

#### Windows

|             |                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Payload** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                        |
| whoami      | See what user the application is running under.                                                                                                                                        |
| dir         | List the contents of the current directory. You may be able to find files such as configuration files, environment files (tokens and application keys), and many more valuable things. |
| ping        | This command will invoke the application to hang. This will be useful in testing an application for blind command injection.                                                           |
| timeout     | This command will also invoke the application to hang. It is also useful for testing an application for blind command injection if the `ping` command is not installed.                |

## Remediating Command Injection
---

Command injection can be prevented in a variety of ways. Everything from minimal use of potentially dangerous functions or libraries in a programming language to filtering input without relying on a user’s input. I have detailed these a bit further below. The examples below are of the PHP programming language; however, the same principles can be extended to many other languages.

  

### **Vulnerable Functions**

In PHP, many functions interact with the operating system to execute commands via shell; these include:

- Exec
- Passthru
- System

  

Take this snippet below as an example. Here, the application will only accept and process numbers that are inputted into the form. This means that any commands such as `whoami` will not be processed.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/14acf436361fcfb7efced4b2f416b3d5.png)

1. The application will only accept a specific pattern of characters (the digits  0-9)
2. The application will then only proceed to execute this data which is all numerical.

  

These functions take input such as a string or user data and will execute whatever is provided on the system. Any application that uses these functions without proper checks will be vulnerable to command injection.

  

### **Input sanitization**

Sanitizing any input from a user that an application uses is a great way to prevent command injection. This is a process of specifying the formats or types of data that a user can submit. For example, an input field that only accepts numerical data or removes any special characters such as `>` ,  `&` and `/`.

In the snippet below, the `filter_input` [PHP function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.filter-input.php) is used to check whether or not any data submitted via an input form is a number or not. If it is not a number, it must be invalid input.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/06e83dfe3791664ed0bb9bc9ffd3e581.png)

  

### Bypassing Filters

Applications will employ numerous techniques in filtering and sanitising data that is taken from a  user's input. These filters will restrict you to specific payloads; however, we can abuse the logic behind an application to bypass these filters. For example, an application may strip out quotation marks; we can instead use the hexadecimal value of this to achieve the same result.

When executed, although the data given will be in a different format than what is expected, it can still be interpreted and will have the same result.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/fd59464e2884390ee1b8bb52b327d454.png)
