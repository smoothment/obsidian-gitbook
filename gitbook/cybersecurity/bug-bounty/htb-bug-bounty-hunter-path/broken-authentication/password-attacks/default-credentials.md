# Default Credentials

Many web applications are set up with default credentials to allow accessing it after installation. However, these credentials need to be changed after the initial setup of the web application; otherwise, they provide an easy way for attackers to obtain authenticated access. As such, [Testing for Default Credentials](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/02-Testing_for_Default_Credentials) is an essential part of authentication testing in OWASP's Web Application Security Testing Guide. According to OWASP, common default credentials include `admin` and `password`.

### Testing Default Credentials

Many platforms provide lists of default credentials for a wide variety of web applications. Such an example is the web database maintained by [CIRT.net](https://www.cirt.net/passwords). For instance, if we identified a Cisco device during a penetration test, we can search the database for default credentials for Cisco devices:

&#x20; &#x20;

Further resources include [SecLists Default Credentials](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials) as well as the [SCADA](https://github.com/scadastrangelove/SCADAPASS/tree/master) GitHub repository which contains a list of default passwords for a variety of different vendors.

A targeted internet search is a different way of obtaining default credentials for a web application. Let us assume we stumble across a [BookStack](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack) web application during an engagement:

&#x20; &#x20;

We can try to search for default credentials by searching something like `bookstack default credentials`:

&#x20; &#x20;

As we can see, the results contain the installation instructions for BookStack, which state that the default admin credentials are&#x20;

```
`admin@admin.com:password`
```
